Hi there! My name is Jesse. I am a PhD student in Computer Science at University of Texas - San Antonio. I joined the [Secure AI Autonomy Lab (SAAL)](https://secureaiautonomylab.github.io/) in 2024, Where I have been advised by Dr Peyman Najafirad, Dr Izzat Alsmadi & Dr Gongbo Liang

My research interests lie in the intersection of neural networks and geospatial automation. Specifically, I am exploring the applications of neural Models and digital Twins to address challenges in GeoAI, including areas such as twin cities, remote sensing, pattern recognition, vision and language models.
