    <article class="content">
        <p>As I have been learning to code these past seven years I discovered 6 rules which I always follow when tackling new code topics.</p>

        <p>Each of these will speed up your learning with greater ease.</p>

        <p>Let's get into it...</p>

        <h2>Learn With a Teacher</h2>

        <p>As a rule of nature coding requires a teacher. It is such a complicated task that it is impossible to learn from the code itself.</p>

        <p>To learn without a teacher is like trying to learn math from looking at equations.</p>

        <p>Even those with 150+ IQ people can't figure that out. These geniuses read documentation and often watch lectures on programming. They learn from someone else, through self-learning.</p>

        <p>Everyone needs someone who already knows how to do the thing to guide your <em>self-learning</em>, inner growth.</p>

        <p>And, by teacher I mean the person who writes the Python documentation on <a href="https://python.org">python.org</a> or the YouTube tutorial or your friend who guides you or even me in this blog.</p>

        <p>Anybody who writes anything in regards to programming is your teacher.</p>

        <p>Yes, anybody.</p>

        <p>We all learn from someone.</p>

        <h3>Pick the best teacher</h3>

        <p>Within this mistake of not using teachers is the neglect to <em>pick the best teachers</em>.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-0.jpeg" alt="Photo by Christin Hume">

        <p>Photo by Christin Hume</p>

        <p>From an array of potential instructors, documentation, Udemy courses, YouTube videos and blogs, you should develop a palate for the best teachers.</p>

        <p>Your taste for learning from a teacher should be developed and practiced.</p>

        <p>Interestingly, everyone has a different taste as to which teachers are best.</p>

        <p>Some people hate Udemy courses or think plain old documentation is the best.</p>

        <p>Me personally, I love Udemy courses and often read documentation while coding.</p>

        <p>But, some people succeed on YouTube tutorials while never reading documentation.</p>

        <p>It is all about personal taste.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-1.jpeg" alt="Photo by Ross Sneddon">

        <p>Photo by Ross Sneddon</p>

        <p>I met an advanced coder who had been coding for 30+ years, he loves to play website documentation with an audio extension and listen while walking with his phone.</p>

        <p>I tried that out after he told me, its actually not that bad.</p>

        <p>But it goes to show we each learn differently.</p>

        <p>What matters is developing how you know yourself to learn the fastest.</p>

        <h2>Learn Concepts and Don't Memorize</h2>

        <p>Oh man, every new developer I know seems to fall into this trap.</p>

        <p>They memorize every function and class, thinking this is the way to "learn" programming.</p>

        <p>In reality there is an infinite number of functions, classes datatypes, syntax and so many other parts to coding.</p>

        <p>It is impossible to learn programming in this fashion.</p>

        <p>You have to be a savant to memorize how to program specifically this way.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-2.jpeg" alt="Photo by Mr. Bochelly">

        <p>Photo by Mr. Bochelly</p>

        <p>Instead what advanced developers do is memorize the concept behind the class or function, then google as they write it.</p>

        <p>Though the function name and parameter is unique to the language, it is universal to the niche.</p>

        <p>So, for example, if we create a class in Python the concept of classes passes to all object oriented languages but the Python syntax is unique.</p>

        <p>Do we memorize the syntax or the concept?</p>

        <p>No, we memorize the concept and look up the syntax while writing the code.</p>

        <p>We do this for everything in coding until we have amassed a great encyclopedia of concepts.</p>

        <p>The syntax and function names should not be manually remembered but put into our unconscious.</p>

        <p>This might sound a bit woo woo, but hear me out.</p>

        <p>As you implement code you learn the concept and write the code.</p>

        <p>As you write there is an imprint of the experience on your neurology.</p>

        <p>Photo by Nico Smit</p>

        <p>There is this old saying that the brain never truly forgets or that the stimulus changes it forever. After every experience the brain is never the same.</p>

        <p>This is what you should aim for when writing code.</p>

        <p>To imprint that experience on your unconscious while consciously understanding concepts & <em>terminology</em> (how else will you describe the concept?).</p>

        <h3>Balance conceptual learning with implementation</h3>

        <p>There is a sort of balance between these things.</p>

        <p>As you learn concepts you have to implement them for these imprints.</p>

        <p>Sometimes you just need to do implementation/imprinting. Sometimes you just need to learn concepts for a while.</p>

        <p>This is where full courses come in.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-4.jpeg" alt="Photo by James">

        <p>Photo by James</p>

        <p>Full courses will help you amass your encyclopedia of concepts and teach you a language.</p>

        <p>There is a dynamic relationship between learning and implementation</p>

        <p>In my previous articles, like my article on full courses I talk about this extensively.</p>

        <p>But, ditch the idea of memorizing functions and instead use a mixture of intellisense, implementation and learning theory.</p>

        <p>Remember to learn terminology as well, as you need to describe these concepts somewhow...</p>

        <h2>Start on a Framework/Niche Last</h2>

        <p>I fell for this trap numerous times. I started a framework/niche before I knew the language.</p>

        <p>In the past, I was excited to start developing a Runescape clone without knowing the primary language, Java, that well.</p>

        <p>I struggled for two months and wondered why it was so hard.</p>

        <p>I sat down and thought, why is this so hard?</p>

        <p>Is it that Runescape is hard to code or is it something else?</p>

        <p>I knew the fundamentals, but there was a bunch of syntax and advanced Java I didn't know.</p>

        <p>I asked my developer friends what my deal was.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-5.png" alt="Code from a Runescape Clone">

        <p>Code from a Runescape Clone</p>

        <p>"How much Java do you know?" was the question they asked.</p>

        <p>I responded, "I don't know I took two college classes in Java".</p>

        <p>They said, in a much longer way, "learn Java first dude, that is really important".</p>

        <p>So that is what I did. I wrote my Runescape clone less and dedicated myself to learning Java on Udemy.</p>

        <p>After 3 months of focusing on Java I felt like I had learned as much as I could from those Udemy courses.</p>

        <p>As I returned to my Runescape clone, I found myself making libraries and engine updates that were much more complex and useful.</p>

        <p>The existing code was way easier to understand.</p>

        <p>Had I not done that I know I would have been stuck in a programming rut.</p>

        <h3>There is an order...</h3>

        <p>There is an order to learning programming, layers on layers.</p>

        <p>If you leave this order it just makes that task much much more difficult.</p>

        <p>Here is the order of learning to code:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Fundamentals</li>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Framework</li>
            <li>Niche</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Each of these has to be learned before the other to optimally understand the niche.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-6.png" alt="Developer tools in Chrome">

        <p>Developer tools in Chrome</p>

        <p>If, for example, you want to get into web development you must understand HTML/CSS and your backend to really have flexibility into your website.</p>

        <p>Even backends like WordPress have a learning curve, a certain order.</p>

        <p>If you want to become a data scientist, you have to learn the fundamentals then Python then NumPy/Pandas and finally the niche.</p>

        <p>Anything outside of that order and well, it just doesn't work. They are requirements of each other, one after the other.</p>

        <h2>Optimize Your Workflow</h2>

        <p>Your workflow is monumental.</p>

        <p>It defines your efficiency.</p>

        <p>Without a good workflow, you work yourself with little progress.</p>

        <p>What is a workflow?</p>

        <p>It is how you create code, publish it and do things.</p>

        <p>Let's say you want to make a hello world app.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-7.png" alt="Notepad">

        <p>Notepad</p>

        <p>Here is one work flow.</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open Notepad</li>
            <li>Type print hello world</li>
            <li>Save it to desktop</li>
            <li>Open command line on desktop</li>
            <li>Run python hello.py from command line on desktop</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Here is another, more optimized one</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Open Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li>Create file</li>
            <li>Type print hello world</li>
            <li>Click run button</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Which is easier?</p>

        <p>Well for me the Visual Studio Code workflow is easier and less stressful.</p>

        <p>But for you, well everyone has different taste.</p>

        <p>All developers have different workflows which they have created.</p>

        <p>As you code and learn you should always be re-creating your workflows and find the optimal one for yourself.</p>

        <p>For example, if you start on an new IDE you have to figure out a new workflow for that editor.</p>

        <p>If you just code inefficiently well, even that is a workflow.</p>

        <p>There are programmers which state developing workflows are a waste of time.</p>

        <p>But, jokes on them, that is a workflow too.</p>

        <p>I absolutely love developing workflows and do it all the time.</p>

        <p>The most fun part is when a new technology or IDE update comes out and you get to quicken your workflow.</p>

        <p>Like how Chat-GPT came into the scene in the early 2020s. Adding Large Language Models to all your coding severely improves production.</p>

        <h2>Use AI to Learn Efficiently</h2>

        <p>You should find looking up framework or language syntax on Google to be somewhat insufficient.</p>

        <p>As much as we don't like to admit it, it kind of always was.</p>

        <p>Search engines have never been the perfect solution to learning to code, but it definitely was <em>the best</em>.</p>

        <p>Nowadays we have gotten closer to perfect. But, with what...</p>

        <p>Guess it....</p>

        <p>LLMs (Language models).</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-8.png" alt="Chat-GPT (2023)">

        <p>Chat-GPT (2023)</p>

        <p>We as developers have found a new way to learn coding.</p>

        <p>Now is an even better time to learn how to code, not worse.</p>

        <p>From 1960-1995 the ultimate way to learn was through textbooks.</p>

        <p>From 1995-2020 the ultimate way was through search engines.</p>

        <p>Now from 2020 forward we are using LLMs.</p>

        <h2>Create a Reference Manual for Every Topic</h2>

        <p>The goal of notes is to teach your future self what you are learning in the present.</p>

        <p>It is really more of a reference manual.</p>

        <img src="../images/6-easy-rules-programmers-should-follow-to-learn-to-code-faster---img-9.png" alt="My notes">

        <p>My notes</p>

        <p>If you learn without notes you are essentially degrading as you stop programming or learn a different niche.</p>

        <p>With a reference manual you create, you can re-teach yourself the old stuff you once knew with much greater speed and ease.</p>

        <p>In addition as you write your reference manual you solidify your learning in the present.</p>

        <p>I write extensively on this topic in an article on creating your own reference manual.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
