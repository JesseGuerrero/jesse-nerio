    <article class="content">
        <p>When I was a teenager I believed laptops were the best and only way to use a computer.</p>

        <p>They are portable and well, they were portable.</p>

        <p>That's it, I thought that was enough.</p>

        <p>"Tower PCs are for boomers anyway" was my thought.</p>

        <p>Problem was, the hardware for laptops was really expensive and I wanted to play the latest video games.</p>

        <p>After a few years of only using a laptop I relented for The Elder Scrolls & PS2 Emulators.</p>

        <p>I got my first higher end tower PC with one monitor.</p>

        <p>I discovered it was rather cheap and extremely effective at doing, well, pretty much everything.</p>

        <p>Though I was confined to my dormitory, I rather enjoyed the speed, large 27" monitor and feeling of a solid keyboard and mouse.</p>

        <h2>Tower PCs Last Longer...</h2>

        <p>I would end up using that tower PC for the next 10 years.</p>

        <p>Even when my PC was becoming senile with old age I still found its slowness superior to a laptops.</p>

        <p>As I was starting graduate school my family decided to help me out and grant me a modern high end tower with two monitors (I asked for it...)</p>

        <p>I am telling you, without this tower I would not have made it through my Masters of Computer Science program.</p>

        <p>All the other students were using laptops and me, with this tower, had a clear advantage.</p>

        <p>Through tutoring other students I could see my homework completion speed, code implementation speed and workflow were much more efficient.</p>

        <p>I would be given homework assignments and finish them within 4 hours while my peers were still setting up Google Collab.</p>

        <p>I would be asked in a tutoring session to help them set it up.</p>

        <h2>Why Two Monitors Are So Good</h2>

        <p>In one of these tutoring sessions one girl was reading documentation into PyTorch, I could see her switching browsers & tabs.</p>

        <p>She was trying to read documentation & her code in Google Collab at the same time.</p>

        <p>The small confines of her laptop screen did not allow her to split the screen in two effectively.</p>

        <p>Essentially her productivity was cut in half and she would have to memorize the differences between the documentation and her IDE.</p>

        <p>I could tell her problem was not a skill issue but an accessibility issue.</p>

        <p>This type of thing was commonplace in university.</p>

        <p>Whenever I got online to help someone in class I rolled my eyes as I saw a good number of them struggling on a laptop.</p>

        <p>Other students who I saw had a solid two monitor gaming tower, though I only tutored two with towers, needed way less guidance and had higher grades.</p>

        <p>Today, out of school, most software engineers I interact with have discovered this necessity.</p>

        <p>From their crisp and clean code, they look like they know what they are doing. When we video chat it is clear they are on a workstation/tower.</p>

        <h2>Solid Positioning Is Superior to Loose Positioning</h2>

        <p>There is something to be said about the solid positioning of a mouse, keyboard & two or three monitors.</p>

        <p>There is an ocular (eye ball) to muscle relationship that happens when everything is in the same place, every time.</p>

        <p>As we move a laptop it seems this relationship is broken.</p>

        <p>A certain stress is put on the user without this relationship.</p>

        <p>My best friend Manu used a laptop all his life.</p>

        <p>For years I told him he needed a tower PC. "I am not a PC wizard like you Jesse, I am not good at computers."</p>

        <p>This is the common saying amongst people who have never tried a real workstation.</p>

        <p>One day, his brother decided to buy Manu a great gift.</p>

        <p>A tower PC with two 27" monitors with better hardware than my PC!</p>

        <p>Guess what happened to Manu?</p>

        <p>He got addicted. At first he was mostly playing video games on it.</p>

        <p>But as he was using the PC, at the age of 26 he found he had a natural aptitude behind all that loose workflow.</p>

        <p>"Dude you were right" he said. "Yup yup Manu, everyone struggles with a laptop, especially coders."</p>

        <p>Manu responded, "yea 3D modelers too".</p>

        <p>For 4 years he did 3D modeling on a laptop.</p>

        <p>And it seems obvious when stating this but he told me the muscle to eye relationship of his tower PC was vastly superior.</p>

        <p>He was finally able to use his artistic skill to a higher degree.</p>

        <h2>It Is Way Easier to Read Large Code Sources</h2>

        <p>A humongous code base, in my opinion, is impossible to understand on a dinky laptop.</p>

        <p>I am sure you can try and possibly (though not likely) succeed.</p>

        <p>I see some coders try this and somewhat succeed.</p>

        <p>But to me they always seem constrained by a lack of muscle to eye connection, a lack of ability to see two monitors and their slower hardware.</p>

        <p>Photo by Yancy Min</p>

        <p>The main reason they succeed in putting in a bunch of commits (lines of code) is because they believe they have the best setup.</p>

        <p>Soon, more often than not, they burn out of this success. Other, more productive developers, seem to eclipse them in their eyes.</p>

        <p>I have heard this multiple times, "I am not a very talented coder."</p>

        <p>What they don't know is, most tools and workflows applicable to large code sources require a tower PC with two monitors.</p>

        <h2>A Cheap Laptop Is Still a Good Idea</h2>

        <p>During graduate school I discovered all classes were at night.</p>

        <p>They were trying to respect the other student's 9-5 jobs.</p>

        <p>For years I always just rented a laptop from the library.</p>

        <p>But now, at night, the library was closed.</p>

        <p>I needed a laptop, but I just needed it for notes and search engine look ups.</p>

        <p>Photo by WebFactory</p>

        <p>I bought a Dell $280 laptop with great specifications.</p>

        <p>The laptop could not handle say Jetbrains but was enough for small IDEs and note taking apps.</p>

        <p>It was amazing, I had no idea what I was missing.</p>

        <p>I took the laptop to my family's house, school, MeetUps and café locations.</p>

        <p>Though I am nowhere near productive on a laptop, it is great fun.</p>

        <p>I discovered the only way to code and be productive on a cheap laptop is to use a remote hosting service to connect to my tower PC at home.</p>

        <p>I never code without being on my tower.</p>

        <p>I can't really code without the internet anyway.</p>

        <p><strong>Using Teamviewer/Anydesk into a tower PC is a great way to boost productivity on a cheap laptop.</strong></p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
