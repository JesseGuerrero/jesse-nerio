        <h1>How to Create Your Own Runescape Private Server (RSPS)</h1>
        <div class="meta"></div>
    </header>

    <article class="content">
        <p>The featured image for this post is a meme I love to send to new people who want to create an RSPS.</p>

        <p>Me, personally, I learned programming through RSPS.</p>

        <p>It was a great experience and I had a ton of fun.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day though, RSPS development is a niche. The main reason to learn how to make a Runescape clone is to learn how to code and have fun.</p>

        <p>Every era of Runescape has been created already. They are at a depth where no single person can recreate it in under 3-5 years of constant development all day.</p>

        <p>Remember Runescape was built by a large team. A single person cannot completely do all tasks of this larger team which took them many years.</p>

        <p>I am saying this to help you set expectations.</p>

        <p>The reality is, most RSPS are mediocre because, well RSPS takes a lot of time.</p>

        <p>Of these four steps for learning to code:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Fundamentals</li>
            <li>Language</li>
            <li>Framework</li>
            <li>Niche</li>
        </ol>

        <p>RSPS is at the very end, #4.</p>

        <p>There is no super in-depth documentation on RSPS and most sources you use as reference are completely different</p>

        <h2>Choose a Language</h2>

        <p>The default and most used language in RSPS is Java.</p>

        <p>However, to start with RSPS I recommend picking any language. It can be any <em>complete</em> language.</p>

        <img src="../images/rsps-img-0.jpeg" alt="Programming languages chart">

        <p>Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/linuxscreenshots/">Linux Screenshots</a></p>

        <p>The goal should be to learn that language well through RSPS.</p>

        <p>You will be using other code sources as a reference. But you should be able to translate their code to your chosen language.</p>

        <p>Much of the functionality of the server should wrap around pre-built libraries.</p>

        <p>So when working in a language like C++, you have to find similar libraries as in your referred source.</p>

        <h2>Choose a Database</h2>

        <p>SQL, No-SQL, Amazon S3, pick the database you want to learn & create.</p>

        <p>I recommend using JSON as your player save and converting in-memory player classes into JSON.</p>

        <p>This is known as serialization.</p>

        <p>Basically, convert the instance of Player into JSON and re-read the JSON file upon server start up.</p>

        <p>Often there are libraries for this, like GSON in Java or nlomann in C++.</p>

        <p>Like this:</p>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;nlohmann/json.hpp&gt;

using json = nlohmann::json;

class MyClass {
public:
    int id;
    std::string name;

    // Constructor
    MyClass(int _id = 0, const std::string& _name = "") : id(_id), name(_name) {}

    // Function to serialize the class to JSON
    json toJson() const {
        return {
            {"id", id},
            {"name", name}
        };
    }

    // Function to deserialize the class from JSON
    static MyClass fromJson(const json& j) {
        return MyClass(j.at("id").get&lt;int&gt;(), j.at("name").get&lt;std::string&gt;());
    }
};</code></pre>

        <p>You essentially convert classes to and from JSON and into your database.</p>

        <h2>Choose Closed-Source or Open-Source</h2>

        <p>There are pros and cons to open-source & closed-source.</p>

        <p>Typically, if you plan on doing microtransactions closed-source is the way to go. You completely own private source servers.</p>

        <p>But, you get a lot of attention with open-source projects.</p>

        <p>I have gotten 15 or so followers on GitHub in 8 months when I was making my open 727 Runescape base.</p>

        <p>The goal of the base was to completely open up 727 to new RSPS developers.</p>

        <p>It got a little popular and I had a lot of fun.</p>

        <p>In the end I joined Darkan RSPS and absolutely love the Darkan source.</p>

        <h2>Always Work From a Base</h2>

        <p>A base is an already functional Client, server & cache which all work together out of the box.</p>

        <p>I always would recommend starting with a base.</p>

        <img src="../images/rsps-img-1.jpeg" alt="Construction workers building">

        <p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@etiennegirardet">Etienne Girardet</a></p>

        <p>At the minimum an RSPS base should have the ability to login, have a lobby, have path-finding and combat.</p>

        <p>This is the minimum and you should not start from a base without these.</p>

        <p>It would take waay to much time and effort starting from a base without these features.</p>

        <p>It is worth searching high and low for bases meeting these requirements.</p>

        <p>In addition I recommend using one primary base and a few secondary reference ones.</p>

        <h2>Choose an era according to a good base</h2>

        <p>The base is the most important part of starting an RSPS.</p>

        <p>Instead of starting with your "favorite era" of Runescape.</p>

        <p>You should have some leeway with yourself and choose a Runescape version which matches a good base.</p>

        <p>I will list some great bases to start from for different revisions:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>2012 Open727: <a href="https://github.com/CSS-Lletya/open727">https://github.com/CSS-Lletya/open727</a></li>

            <li>2004Scape: <a href="https://github.com/2004scape">https://github.com/2004scape</a></li>

        </ol>

        <p>So pick one main base to refer to like the ones above and several other bases to refer to during your development.</p>

        <h2>Always refer to Rune-Server and other RSPS devs</h2>

        <p>When building on top of a base, google search, LLMs and other RSPS devs are your greatest research resources.</p>

        <p>Most answers will be on Rune-Server. You should also join the <a href="https://discord.gg/rune-server">Rune-server discord</a> to ask questions to other developers.</p>

        <h2>The best reference RSPS base</h2>

        <p>I have looked through a lot of RSPS bases. By far, the cleanest, most performant and thorough code source is <a href="https://github.com/DarkanRS/world-server">DarkanRSPS Remake</a>.</p>

        <img src="../images/rsps-img-2.png" alt="Darkan 2012 Remake logo">

        <p>Every feature you need for recreating Runescape exists in that open-source project.</p>

        <p>In reality, Darkan has a lobby that is closed -source.</p>

        <p>Which means you cannot use it as a base.</p>

        <p>But, Darkan is a treasure trove of information you can use in your private source as a reference.</p>

        <h2>Create a Plugin System</h2>

        <p>This is standard RSPS practice.</p>

        <p>One of the first things you should do when coding an RSPS is create a plugin system.</p>

        <p>The goal is to be able to write gameplay code anywhere in your code source.</p>

        <p>An example of this can be found in Darkan, take a look:</p>

<pre><code>@PluginEventHandler
public class ImpCatcher extends QuestOutline {
    //...
    public static NPCClickHandler mizgogHandler = new NPCClickHandler(new Object[] { WIZARD_MIZGOG }, e -&gt; {
        if (e.getOption().equalsIgnoreCase("talk-to"))
            e.getPlayer().startConversation(new MizgogD(e.getPlayer()));
        else if (e.getOption().equalsIgnoreCase("trade") && e.getPlayer().isQuestComplete(Quest.IMP_CATCHER))
            ShopsHandler.openShop(e.getPlayer(), "wizard_mizgog");
        else
            e.getPlayer().startConversation(new MizgogD(e.getPlayer()));
    });
}</code></pre>

        <p>NPCClickHandler is one of 25+ plugins. These plugins allow you to attach code to NPCs, items, tiles, game objects, the player, the server itself and more.</p>

        <p>Take a look:</p>

        <img src="../images/rsps-img-3.png" alt="Plugin handlers list in IDE">

        <p>I can copy and paste any of those handlers anywhere in the source and it will work.</p>

        <h2>Create Views in a Database</h2>

        <p>As you develop your server, you should make a highscores file to database output to constantly update your hiscores.</p>

        <p>Player save files and hiscores save files inside a database are a requirement for creating a website for your RSPS.</p>

        <p>This likely is best embedded in the server.</p>

        <p>In Darkan there is a grand exchange view, highscores view and player view.</p>

        <img src="../images/rsps-img-4.png" alt="Database views in IDE">

        <p>From there you have the choice of making an API inside your server or as a microservice.</p>

        <h2>Summary</h2>

        <p>It can be frustrating to not make the progress you would like in RSPS development.</p>

        <p>It is a slow process and instead of aiming for extraordinary progress, it is best instead to just have fun.</p>

        <p>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@6heinz3r">Gabriel Heinzer</a></p>

        <p>In addition, you will find yourself refactoring all your code every few months.</p>

        <p>Your first draft of RSPS code will always be dirty and non-performant, at least to your future self.</p>

        <p>Keep in mind you will grow. A year from now you may cringe at the code you write today.</p>

        <p>Lastly, remember, picking a good primary base is the most impactful part to your development speed.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
