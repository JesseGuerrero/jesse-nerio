    <article class="content">
        <p>You will always see the most benefit by first mastering the fundamentals of a craft.</p>

        <p>In all fields and practices the fundamentals are the most transferrable pieces of knowledge for all parts of a craft. Fundamentals are the essential building blocks of a topic, which is why they are called fundamentals or foundational to future progress.</p>

        <p>I will be overviewing key concepts one at a time by terminology in order of requirement.</p>

        <p>We will go over 19 concepts, quickly.</p>

        <p>I go through it from its most real perspective and not in the same way a boot camp would.</p>

        <p>This should help take a lot of the mysticism out of programming.</p>

        <h2>Binary number</h2>
        <p>Binary numbers are the number system computers run off of.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-1.jpeg" alt="Binary numbers">

        <p>The reason computers use binary numbers is to count 0s and 1s as electrical signals off and on.</p>

        <p>This makes all math simple in a computer as all we need is a series of 1s and 0s to represent all math.</p>

        <p>Here are some representations of binary numbers:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>12 is 1100</li>
            <li>13 is 1101</li>
            <li>20 is 10100</li>
            <li>40 is 101000</li>
            <li>80 is 1010000</li>
            <li>100 is 1100100</li>
        </ol>

        <p>A series of numbers are used this way to add, subtract, divide, etc.</p>

        <h2>Abstraction</h2>
        <p>Abstraction is why code exists. It means to take something specific and make it mean something more broad.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-2.jpeg" alt="Abstraction concept">

        <p>The abstraction of a cat is an animal. An abstraction of an animal is a species. An abstraction of a species is a living organism.</p>

        <p>We get more and more broad and each one means the other. So it is the same with computers.</p>

        <p>Our computer screens are an abstraction of binary math being done inside the hardware.</p>

        <p>We interpret and read the signs of this math and do mighty things while never knowing the binary changes being done on the CPU.</p>

        <h2>System Clock</h2>
        <p>There is an electrical loop, a rhythm, a beat, also known as a clock running inside all your electrical devices.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-3.jpeg" alt="System clock">

        <p>Electricity runs on a loop going through your entire computer.</p>

        <p>From the power supply, or the plug into your wall, an electric current runs into the motherboard then to every device bringing life to all the hardware.</p>

        <p>The number of loops your hardware goes through is known as a GHz. This is a rate of a billion electrical loops going through your hardware per second.</p>

        <p>1 GHz is 1 billion electrical loops through all your hardware per second. 2 GHz is 2 billion per second.</p>

        <p>For every loop the electrical current goes through transistors and switches in a series of on and off signals order how the hardware produces electricity.</p>

        <p>These on and off signals are 0s and 1s.</p>

        <p>The system clock is the heart rate of your computer. The electric current ticks in the billions per second as the blood.</p>

        <h2>CPU</h2>
        <p>Central Processing Unit, has math abilities built into the hardware so that we can abstract the math using code.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-4.jpeg" alt="CPU">

        <p>Most modern CPUs have 100s to 1000s of built-in math functions that code abstracts for developers and users.</p>

        <p>As a system clock goes into the CPU, signals are turned off and on based on the built-in math.</p>

        <p>The input is a series of bits streaming from the system clock and the output is math done on the bits from the CPU.</p>

        <p>Here are some built-in math functions which are used on the binary numbers 0s and 1s as examples:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Addition</li>
            <li>Subtraction</li>
            <li>Multiplication</li>
            <li>Division</li>
            <li>Square root</li>
            <li>Exponent</li>
            <li>Logarithm</li>
            <li>Trigonometric functions</li>
            <li>Many more etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Transistor</h2>
        <p>This is the core of computation.</p>

        <p>Transistors allow logic of the off and on signals to store different series of numbers in memory.</p>

        <p>All built-in math functions of your CPU are an abstraction of the following:</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-5.png" alt="Logic gates">

        <p>These are gates from binary numbers which when put together in complex series of transistors to make a built-in math function.</p>

        <p>Like this:</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-7.jpeg" alt="Transistor circuit">

        <p>That is what a built-in math function on the CPU would look like but much more complex as a series of hardware built-in transistors inside the CPU.</p>

        <h2>Map</h2>
        <p>A direct association between an address and memory.</p>

        <p>So, "hello" may result in 52 and an address like 10110 may result in 15.</p>

        <p>Mapping is a fundamentals type of memory in computers.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of a map:</p>

        <p>Key maps to value.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-9.png" alt="Map example">

        <p>So if we ask for "key" we get "value".</p>

        <p>"Address" gives us "result" and "adress2" gives us 101110.</p>

        <h2>Memory</h2>
        <p>All computer hardware which holds memory accepts a series of binary numbers as addresses.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-8.jpeg" alt="Computer memory">

        <p>Then from those series of addresses outputs the binary bits as memory.</p>

        <p>It is a map of address to bytes of data which store information for the computer.</p>

        <p>All computer memory works on mapping address to bytes of memory this way.</p>

        <p>A series of read addresses are brought in from the system clock and the output is a stream of memorized bits from those addresses.</p>

        <h2>RAM</h2>
        <p>Random Access Memory is a specific hardware which holds binary addresses mapped to series of bytes.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-10.png" alt="RAM">

        <p>The majority of hardware in you computer accesses memory through RAM.</p>

        <p>In addition most programs are stored in RAM while they run.</p>

        <p>This includes your Operating System.</p>

        <p>RAM is wiped every restart.</p>

        <h2>Programming language</h2>
        <p>A programming language dictates a series of built-in math operations in your hardware.</p>

        <p>But the series you are coding up as a developer are abstracted so much you use programming languages to order these built-in maths.</p>

        <p>Printing "hello" in Python has such a ridiculous amount of built-in math inside it, it would make your eyes boggle.</p>

        <p>But our ancestors have created a system which allows such abstraction we can call all all this math with the simple "print" keyword.</p>

        <p>We do this with programming languages to the point we are orchestrating the computer to do mighty things.</p>

        <p>These things are done with minimal effort and easily digestible code.</p>

        <h2>Code source</h2>
        <p>This is what we consider to be software.</p>

        <p>A code source is a series of instructions to your computer run live on your hardware.</p>

        <p>It is written in a programming language which both you and your computer understand.</p>

        <p>It is saved as bits and shared between many peoples.</p>

        <h2>Software</h2>
        <p>Everything not built-in to the hardware itself would be considered software, including your operating system.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-11.png" alt="Microsoft Word">

        <p>Software is any abstraction of built-in math functions in the hardware. It is a code source.</p>

        <p>It is software because it exist in-memory as binary bits and not as a physical device or hardware.</p>

        <p>If you wipe all stored bits on your device, all software will disappear and all hardware would remain.</p>

        <p>This is what makes it "soft".</p>

        <p>All software is stored as 0s and 1s and uses built-in math functions.</p>

        <p>The two components of software are the storage needed and the code needed.</p>

        <p>Code dictates how the built-in math functions manipulate 0s and 1s in-memory.</p>

        <p>All software requires code.</p>

        <p>The storage holds existing 0s and 1s needed for the software to abstract your hardware enough.</p>

        <p>This is to show these binary numbers as lets say the blog you are looking at, or the operating system you are running on.</p>

        <h2>Computer Science</h2>
        <p>The study of the interrelation of man and machine. How can humans interact with machines? What is their experience? How do we create an experience?</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-12.jpeg" alt="Computer Science">

        <p>These are the questions we ask as a computer scientist.</p>

        <p>We essentially build software for man and study how to use hardware already built.</p>

        <h2>Compilation</h2>
        <p>Because there is an abstraction of bits to a programming language, language must be converted to readable bits by the computer.</p>

        <p>These readable bits are known as an executable.</p>

        <p>Something which can readily be executed by the computer.</p>

        <p>This conversion is compilation.</p>

        <p>Your code is being compiled into readable bits and placed separately in memory from your code.</p>

        <p>You can then run your compiled bits as a binary file.</p>

        <p>It is called binary file because it is a series of 0s and 1s.</p>

        <p>In Windows we call this an executable or .exe.</p>

        <h2>Code errors</h2>
        <p>You have imagined a software to be run.</p>

        <p>If it does not run as intended, this is known as a code error.</p>

        <p>Either something you wrote in the code does not match your logic.</p>

        <p>Or the underlying programming language, compiler or other factors into writing your code are misaligned.</p>

        <h2>Code environment</h2>
        <p>A code environment is the natural habitat of your code.</p>

        <p>This is all parts which affect the code but are not directly the code.</p>

        <p>All these parts that form around the code are the environment.</p>

        <p>Lets look at some examples of things which are part of the code environment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating system</li>
            <li>IDE</li>
            <li>Files in your project</li>
            <li>The structure of your folders</li>
            <li>The dependencies for your project</li>
            <li>The build tool</li>
            <li>Programming language version</li>
            <li>The shell language you are running, bash, powershell, etc.</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Syntax error</h2>
        <p>Each programming language has a structure to it.</p>

        <p>A specific ordering of keywords or required format of characters.</p>

        <p>If for example in Python you were to type out pint instead of print there would be a syntax error such as this one...</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-15.png" alt="Syntax error example">

        <p>Any misspellings, lack of spaces or characters would be a syntax error because you are not following the language.</p>

        <h2>Compile-time</h2>
        <p>While your code is being converted to instructions in bits it takes a little time from start to end to convert your code.</p>

        <p>During this time is considered compile-time.</p>

        <p>Code errors show up and are known as compilation errors.</p>

        <p>Syntax errors, environment errors and many other errors do show up at compile-time.</p>

        <h2>Runtime</h2>
        <p>While a code source AKA software is running on the computer it is streaming through the system clock.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-16.jpeg" alt="Runtime">

        <p>It runs through the blood cycle of the hardware and is being accessed through the CPU into the RAM and hardware.</p>

        <p>When a software is alive like this.</p>

        <p>When it is in-action.</p>

        <p>We call this run-time.</p>

        <h2>Interpreter</h2>
        <p>An interpreter compiles code line by line top to bottom then runs each line individually.</p>

        <p>It is a live compilation then run at every part of the code.</p>

        <p>This is also known as scripting.</p>

        <p>By default Python runs like this.</p>

        <p>When a language is being interpreted it is run top to bottom.</p>

        <p>Line 1 is run first all the way to line 5.</p>

        <p>The instructions bits do not know what goes after it.</p>

        <p>Any language can be put into interpretation format or compilation format.</p>

        <p>In an interpreted format the function below would not run...</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-19.png" alt="Interpreted function example">

        <p>I get not defined.</p>

        <p>However in compilation we do get that function...</p>

        <img src="../images/the-code-fundamentals-part-1-img-20.png" alt="Compiled function example">

        <p>This is because compilation goes through the entire code source and makes mappings to all parts of the code before it runs.</p>

        <p>While interpreters go line by line converting to machine code, then running that individual line of machine code, compilers save everything in maps then runs it all.</p>

        <p>Interpreters also store all previous lines of course so future machine code works.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
