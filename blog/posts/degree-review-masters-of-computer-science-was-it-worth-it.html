        <p>Is a Masters of Computer Science worth it?</p>

        <p>Should you go for a graduate program?</p>

        <p>What is it like to go through a masters program?</p>

        <p>Well, I can't tell you these things.</p>

        <p>I can give you my experience and it should help you decide.</p>

        <p>There are realities universities are not telling you about the job marketplace.</p>

        <p>It is a lot more dreary than you might imagine.</p>

        <p>I remember the promises of a job.</p>

        <p>The advertisements that after a degree, "the world is your oyster".</p>

        <p>Though in truth the world of academic achievement is a bit more dystopian than you may think.</p>

        <p>First I will tell you what and how I learned, and then I will go into the details of whether it was worth it.</p>

        <p>I will also talk about getting a job with a graduate degree.</p>

        <p>Lets take a look at a Masters degree in Computer Science.</p>

        <h2>What I learned</h2>

        <p>I mostly learned through self-study.</p>

        <img src="../images/degree-review-masters-img-0.jpeg" alt="Photo by Compare Fibre">

        <p>My school guided me but 80%+ of my learning was self-imposed.</p>

        <p>Students were passing by simply finishing assignments and not studying on their own.</p>

        <p>I always felt they did not get the full benefit of the degree because of this.</p>

        <p>In my self-study I switched technologies every semester based on what we were learning in class.</p>

        <p>I followed the syllabus, took Udemy courses and finished a good majority of them around the syllabus.</p>

        <p>This meant if I took a databases class I took a databases Udemy course.</p>

        <p>If I took a machine learning class, I took a PyTorch Udemy course.</p>

        <p>When we were learning penetration testing and Linux exploits, I went through a Linux Udemy course.</p>

        <p>The one skill I learned from my university which can only be taught at university was academic writing & research.</p>

        <img src="../images/degree-review-masters-img-1.png" alt="My Academic Papers">

        <p>Now that was a very difficult thing to figure out.</p>

        <p>What do academic journals want to see?</p>

        <p>How do you format and research for your writing?</p>

        <p>Posting on Google Scholar and journals is very difficult to learn at the beginning.</p>

        <p>Academic writing is its own class of literary art.</p>

        <p>And although its nice to have research papers officially published in your name, <em>no one really cares</em>.</p>

        <p>I remember posting my first three research papers in academic journals.</p>

        <p>Heck I even got put into a Spanish Machine Learning textbook in Mexico.</p>

        <p>But, if you mention this in an interview it grants you 0 points.</p>

        <img src="../images/degree-review-masters-img-2.jpeg" alt="Photo by Stock Birken">

        <p>You do not pass go and you do not collect $200.</p>

        <p>Best case scenario you get a "that's nice" and a superficial smile.</p>

        <p>Maybe amongst friends you can flex with it and get a few respect points.</p>

        <p>In the end I took 14 classes and 1 community college course for that degree.</p>

        <p>The classes & lectures were difficult but actually became easy because I learned ahead of the material.</p>

        <p>I feel the degree was worth it, not because of the school teaching me things.</p>

        <p>But, because it gave me the motivation to teach myself with intensity and gave me the confidence to identify myself as a "programmer".</p>

        <h2>It is quite possible I am actually less employable now</h2>

        <p>I will be honest, I do not have a job.</p>

        <img src="../images/degree-review-masters-img-3.jpeg" alt="Photo by Sebastian Herrmann">

        <p>After graduating I am unable to even get interviews despite having a very strong resume, skillset and background.</p>

        <p>I have a few software engineering friends that don't even have a degree and they get more interviews and even job offers.</p>

        <p>One in particular says he rejects potential applicants who have a Masters of Computer Science because they are usually worse than those who are self-taught.</p>

        <p>Take a look at these statistics:</p>

        <img src="../images/degree-review-masters-img-4.png" alt="One Job Application">

        <p>53% in a 712 applicant pool have a Masters of Computer Science.</p>

        <p>Only 3% have a high school degree as their highest form of education.</p>

        <p>You are actually more distinguished by not having an academic degree.</p>

        <p>If you do not have a college education and you get an interview, it is much more impressive to know about software development.</p>

        <p>The employer simply has lower expectations for you.</p>

        <p>Exceeding them is much simpler.</p>

        <p>And this statistic is not an anomaly.</p>

        <p>If you get LinkedIn Premium and look at the statistics for <em>every</em> job you will see these stats.</p>

        <p>The software engineering market is simply overrun by graduate student applicants.</p>

        <p>This degree has lost all meaning.</p>

        <h2>Why it was worth it</h2>

        <p>For me in particular it was worth it.</p>

        <p>Not because it improved my job prospects, because it probably didn't.</p>

        <img src="../images/degree-review-masters-img-6.jpeg" alt="Photo by Kenny Eliason">

        <p>But because it was <em>free</em>.</p>

        <p>I had a full ride scholarship to whichever major I chose due to my high grades and academic achievement.</p>

        <p>Before the graduate program it took me 4 months to decide between a degree in social work and a degree in Computer Science.</p>

        <p>Both were free.</p>

        <p>I chose Computer Science for the job prospect and because I love programming.</p>

        <p>In the thing I set out to do I would say that graduate degree, that degree in Computer Science was a bust.</p>

        <p>It did not fulfill the job I desired it to do from the beginning.</p>

        <p>But, I didn't pay for it.</p>

        <p>So I feel it came out even.</p>

        <h2>I have applied to over 1,300 jobs</h2>

        <p>At this point the only reason I am still applying for software engineering jobs after over a year is sunk cost.</p>

        <img src="../images/degree-review-masters-img-7.jpeg" alt="Photo by Markus Winkler">

        <p>I put so much time and effort into learning to program.</p>

        <p>7 years of work to be precise.</p>

        <p>I would love to actually use it and continue using it.</p>

        <p>I have applied to over 1300 jobs and get an interview in about 1/100 applications.</p>

        <p>I feel I have come so close to getting a job a few times.</p>

        <p>I have gotten to the final stages of interviewing twice.</p>

        <p>We will see how this continues.</p>

        <p>My degree at this point is worth more for the confidence and dedication it gives me to the job process than the certification after the fact.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>

        <p>The reality about graduation and state of the job market is a bit dark.</p>

        <p>For me though, a Masters Degree was worth it.</p>

        <p>But that may or may not be the case for you.</p>

        <p>It all depends on your circumstances.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
