    <article class="content">
        <p>New college students tend to choose their major based on how they view themselves.</p>

        <p>It can get pretty simple. Some just want a job, some want clout and others just wanna to appease their parents and pick something easy.</p>

        <p>Students make these decisions in estimation of themselves.</p>

        <p>If they believe they are smart they choose a "hard" major and if they believe they are less intelligent they try an "easy" major.</p>

        <p>"Computer Science and Computer Engineering seem too hard" is the typical statement. They then choose Information Systems.</p>

        <p>Truth is, Information Systems is the alternative easier tech major.</p>

        <p>Information Systems is usually easier than Computer Science.</p>

        <p>Every information systems class I ever took was learning to <em>use</em> technology rather than <em>making</em> technology.</p>

        <p>In Computer Science we make software. In Computer Engineering we make hardware. In Information Systems we simply use software and hardware.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-0.jpeg" alt="Server room with professionals">

        <p>Things like managing a server rack, doing administration for an online business, managing a WordPress business and many other jobs are covered by Information Systems.</p>

        <p>It is a broad education on using software and hardware in a business setting.</p>

        <h2>With a systems major you are open for jobs</h2>

        <p>This is the major appeal of Information Systems, the openness to work anywhere.</p>

        <p>For the Information Systems major you are preparing for <em>any</em> job and not a focused field.</p>

        <p>For this reason you can afford to have an open mind with this major. You can work anywhere there is technology which is pretty much any job.</p>

        <p>You can become a recruiter, marketer with social media, WordPress administrator, executive assistant, endless possibilities.</p>

        <p>This is unlike Computer Science where we hyper focus on programming/security or Computer Engineering where its all on the hardware.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-1.jpeg" alt="Narrow alleyway representing focused paths">

        <p>Computer Science and engineering majors have a pretty narrow focus.</p>

        <p>Me personally I set myself for a hyper focus on Computer Science for the past 7 years.</p>

        <p>Within this field I had searched for a job for the past 1.5 years with zero offers.</p>

        <p>On LinkedIn I saw my peers getting jobs in non-engineering roles all the time despite they themselves getting a Computer Science degree (they pivoted out).</p>

        <p>The difference between me and my peers was my closing of opportunities to only software engineering.</p>

        <p>Where as our goal in Information Systems is to perform business with technology.</p>

        <h2>Why get an Information Systems degree?</h2>

        <p>The best use case of an Information Systems degree is to introduce someone who knows very little about technology to technology.</p>

        <p>For this specific use case I always recommend getting a desktop tower, a good one.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-2.jpeg" alt="University lecture hall">

        <p>As a new person to computers the combination of systems classes and a desktop can become phenomenal. You get a University course on learning tech and have a desktop to test everything on. With these you can learn how to use a computer really really well in a few years.</p>

        <p>It may seems strange for me to advocate for a desktop tower in the middle of this section.</p>

        <p>But the usefulness of this major improves dramatically with an actual desktop PC so I had to mention it here.</p>

        <p>So, if you are not a techy person but really want to learn how to <em>use</em> computers, then this major is for you.</p>

        <p>If you are a techy person then perhaps Computer Science or Computer Engineering. Though it is highly competitive.</p>

        <p>If you only want to focus on soft skills and leadership, then purely Business Administration.</p>

        <h2>Information Systems is not easy</h2>

        <p>When I started in Information Systems I thought it would be easy. At my university specifically, it was pretty difficult.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-3.png" alt="Difficulty comparison chart">

        <p>For sure Information Systems is more difficult than Business Administration and easier than Computer Science.</p>

        <p>What really did it for me, I hadn't had a computer in years. I had just started college without a laptop and knew little about technology at the time.</p>

        <p>This major was an introduction to technology for me at 27 years old. Had I been a techy person it likely would have been a lot easier.</p>

        <h2>It is just business</h2>

        <p>All businesses use technology in one way or another. In the past there was a focus on soft skills and <em>the art of the deal</em> type operations.</p>

        <p>Back then you were essentially a salesman managing hard assets and property.</p>

        <p>After the 1980s and the internet we are required to have an online presence and automation.</p>

        <p>Because of this, I have no idea why we still have pure Business Administration majors.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-4.png" alt="Business and technology meeting">

        <p>Business administration was my first major. I had 2 speech classes, soft skills courses and professionalism classes.</p>

        <p>We <em>simulated</em> a business through a video game where we were required to meet in teams.</p>

        <p>These business meetings were meant to teach us how to conduct ourselves. Business Administration was a very narrow focus on soft skills, finance, business concepts, social media usage and software applications.</p>

        <p>It was so cheesy I just cringed at it.</p>

        <p>I didn't feel like I was really learning business. I was more learning how to be a good employee, which I guess is good too.</p>

        <p>For a bachelors degree I guess its okay. You need to know this stuff.</p>

        <p>But its more of a general education for sure.</p>

        <p>Information systems had these classes but replaced half the soft skills classes with software classes.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-5.jpeg" alt="Code on computer screen">

        <p>Toward the end of my undergrad I switched to Information Systems and thoroughly felt everything was more relevant to the modern world.</p>

        <p>We were taught SQL, Cloud administration with Google Cloud, Python scripting, basic programming, Tableau, Linux, things that are actually used.</p>

        <p>Information systems is basically technology and business while business administration is soft skills and business.</p>

        <p>Information Systems is a modern version of business administration. I can see a Masters in Information Systems being more useful than an MBA.</p>

        <p>That is just my view, but I at the present I am a purely techy person. Not the public speaking type and not the salesman.</p>

        <h2>How to be successful during an Information Systems degree</h2>

        <p>A degree doesn't hold much weight nowadays, even in Information Systems.</p>

        <p>You need soft skills and proof of concept for you tech abilities.</p>

        <p>Let's see what you can do for these while you study.</p>

        <h2>Practice facilitation and public speaking</h2>

        <p>Being this major is an open field you need to train your soft skills. How you might ask?</p>

        <p>How in the world does a person train their ability to communicate?</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-6.jpeg" alt="Team meeting and presentation">

        <p>The answer is <em>solving social-based problems</em>.</p>

        <p>There are two ways I recommend this be done, #1 free/paid leadership #2 religious leadership.</p>

        <p>#1 means volunteering or paying for a club or organization where you have to lead.</p>

        <p>#2 is joining a church or religious group and practicing group leadership in your religion.</p>

        <p>Both of these train soft skills by solving social problems.</p>

        <p>Examples of social problems are things like:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Complete a Bible study</li>
            <li>Lead a meeting in ABC organization</li>
            <li>Complete a presentation</li>
            <li>Teach a class</li>
            <li>Introduce a person to your religion</li>
            <li>Etc. etc.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>These are <em>problems</em> and you are problem solving by using soft skills.</p>

        <h2>Certifications are your friend</h2>

        <p>In Computer Science there is a funny phenomenon. The right certifications are worth more than the degree.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-7.png" alt="CompTIA Security+ Certification">

        <p>Stuff like an AWS certification, Security+ certification, Kubernetes certification are worth a lot.</p>

        <p>In Information Systems it is no different. In between your classes Security+ would be a fantastic addition to your degree.</p>

        <p>These are hard requirements for many jobs; a bachelors degree in tech and Security+.</p>

        <p>In my present time, 2024 I have seen a lot of people get jobs on just that(non-engineering).</p>

        <h2>Interview while in college</h2>

        <p>During your university time applying for jobs, interviewing and getting certificates are essential.</p>

        <p>I made this huge mistake in college where I had not interviewed during my studies.</p>

        <p>When I had graduated I started interviewing for the first time and thoroughly sucked.</p>

        <img src="../images/navigating-your-future--a-comprehensive-guide-to-the-information-systems-major---img-8.jpeg" alt="Group interview preparation">

        <p>By practicing when you don't need a job, you can condition yourself to <em>like</em> interviewing.</p>

        <p>You can learn what is required for jobs, then fulfill those requirements in personal study.</p>

        <p>With intentional practice over months of interviewing you can get so good at it, it is like flexing.</p>

        <p>A year and a half later, my interviewing skills are way better and I actually enjoy interviews. Had I done this in college it would have been much less nerve wrecking as I would not have needed the jobs so much while in school.</p>

        <p>Life or death interviews are not fun. Having school on the side makes the interview less important AKA easier to do.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>
