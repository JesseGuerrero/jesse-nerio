        <h1>Advance Your Code Skills Faster: How to Learn Programming Languages Well</h1>
        <div class="meta"></div>
    </header>

    <article class="content">
        <p>Lets say you already picked a language.</p>

        <p>You wish to learn and you wish to learn fast.</p>

        <p>How is this done?</p>

        <p>Why should I do it?</p>

        <p>What does it take to learn a language?</p>

        <p>If you do not have a language in mind I wrote an article on <a href="how-should-i-pick-a-language-to-start-coding-like-a-superstar.html">picking your first language</a>.</p>

        <p>But, how do we start?</p>

        <p>Well, there are two things you must consider.</p>

        <p>First, if you have never learned a language before you might think its as easy as 20 hours or so.</p>

        <p>This is not the case.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-0.png" alt="Learning programming takes time">

        <p>It takes minimum 300+ hours for basic proficiency and if you want to master something it takes minimum 1000's of hours.</p>

        <p>A better perspective is to push any notion that you can learn coding quickly out of your mind.</p>

        <p>Second, any type of coding will help you grow as a programmer.</p>

        <h2>Stick to a niche you love</h2>

        <p>For the sake of coding <em>anything</em> a niche you absolutely love should sustain you these 1000+ hours.</p>

        <p>Honestly, you should be smiling while coding some niche and watching yourself grow.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-1.png" alt="Figma website">

        <p>General categories of niches are game development, website design, machine learning and so much more.</p>

        <p>But within these general categories exist specific niches which should be sought out.</p>

        <p>Here are some good examples of niches:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>World of Warcraft Private server development</li>
            <li>Runescape private server development</li>
            <li>Open-source language models</li>
            <li>Classic game remakes (Diablo 1/2, Super Mario)</li>
            <li>Console emulator development</li>
            <li>Crypto bot development</li>
            <li>Computer vision learning</li>
            <li>Minecraft client/server development</li>
            <li>Figma design</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Each of the niches I mentioned have actual teams and dedicated Discord groups.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-2.png" alt="Minecraft servers">

        <p>For many people a game like Minecraft was a childhood past time.</p>

        <p>They can easily make plugins or code their own mods in Java with little perceived effort.</p>

        <p>As they code time slips away and they hadn't realized its been 6 hours.</p>

        <p>That type of love for a niche is what you are looking for.</p>

        <p>The love for programming itself often comes later.</p>

        <h2>Go through a full course on the language</h2>

        <p>From the start we do not know what we <em>need</em> to know.</p>

        <p>It is impossible for us to see it without looking back as an expert.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-3.png" alt="Learning from courses">

        <p>You will encounter naysayers of learning through online course series.</p>

        <p>They say...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Guided learning teaches nothing"</li>
            <li>"I can never learn through a video"</li>
            <li>"I can only learn by coding itself"</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Get these thoughts out of your mind.</p>

        <p>Guided learning is absolutely essential.</p>

        <p>Structure eases the entire process.</p>

        <p>Typically these programmers have forgotten they had teachers.</p>

        <p>More often than not great programmers had great teachers.</p>

        <p>And yes, there are some people with a 150 IQ that simply learn too fast for a teacher.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-4.png" alt="Teacher in classroom">

        <p>But it is more common for us the good teacher produces great learning.</p>

        <p>To find these courses, the best place to go would be Udemy.</p>

        <p>It is worth the price.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, free YouTube courses would be the alternative.</p>

        <p>What you want to look for is "zero to hero", "masterclass" or "complete" courses on a language.</p>

        <h2>Learn for the niche</h2>

        <p>When you pick your course, you should do so with your niche in mind first and foremost.</p>

        <p>The question to ask, "If I am going to code this niche, what do I need to learn?"</p>

        <p>The answer, language first, niche second.</p>

        <p>But learn the language for the niche.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-5.png" alt="Learning with passion">

        <p>There should be a spark of excitement which drives you to complete a Udemy course on Kotlin, for example.</p>

        <p>The course and some project or niche you are engaged in should match up.</p>

        <h2>Use LLMs as a personal tutor</h2>

        <p>As you are coding and doing full courses you should use other resources, particularly LLMs.</p>

        <p>LLMs are a new standard of learning.</p>

        <p>It is not cheating or a "shortcut".</p>

        <p>It is an essential part of being a programmer.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-6.png" alt="ChatGPT for coding">

        <p>Ask the LLM (Large Language Model) a question from your Udemy course or niche.</p>

        <p>Tell it to explain code and computer science concepts.</p>

        <p>You will find it is extremely helpful.</p>

        <p>Treat LLMs like they are a mentor of programming.</p>

        <p>They can give an entire conversation in regards to one specific thing you can get nowhere else.</p>

        <p>Google is not even relevant anymore.</p>

        <h2>Consume a variety of teaching styles</h2>

        <p>A major point to learning a language is consuming the same content from different sources.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-7.png" alt="Learning from multiple sources">

        <p>Let us say you are struggling with threads in programming (its okay to not know what that is)</p>

        <p>You learn one thing from the Udemy course.</p>

        <p>You don't quite get it.</p>

        <p>So you ask an LLM to explain it to you.</p>

        <p>You get it better.</p>

        <p>You might even understand it.</p>

        <p>Push your memory further and look up a YouTube video on the same topic.</p>

        <p>The more different ways you hear the same topic explained the easier it is to grasp and recall later.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-8.png" alt="Student studying">

        <p>Often it is a good idea to mix learning sources...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Learn from the video course</li>
            <li>Look up another teacher (YouTube)</li>
            <li>Ask an LLM</li>
            <li>Read a blog on it</li>
            <li>Code it in your niche</li>
            <li>Read code from some source</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Mixing these will grant a deeper understanding and enforce a firm memory.</p>

        <h2>The ideal scenario</h2>

        <p>The ideal scenario is to find a <strong>solid community</strong>.</p>

        <p>Often, this ideal scenario is impossible to find which is why I recommend it last.</p>

        <p>But, if you recognize it from what I am about to tell you then take it.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-9.png" alt="Community project">

        <p>The best communities are those where its <strong>one big project</strong>.</p>

        <p>Usually with 1 or 2 leaders.</p>

        <p>This leader takes care of his/her contributors, reviews code and gives feedback on how to improve their project.</p>

        <p>I have never seen better communities than those which wrap around a project.</p>

        <p>These projects often have an open-source website, API and a few code sources.</p>

        <p>For your own perception, examples for these ideal communities would be...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Spartan Engine (C++)</li>
            <li>2011Scape (Kotlin)</li>
            <li>Azeroth World of Warcraft (C++)</li>
            <li>Any Minecraft server</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In addition the even more ideal scenario is where the leader and community culture match your political or religious views.</p>

        <img src="../images/advance-your-code-skills-faster--how-to-learn-programming-languages-well---img-10.png" alt="Community culture">

        <p>I know that sounds wonky but every project community out there has a culture for its entire community, usually set by the leader.</p>

        <p>If the culture fits, the niche is fire and the leader is leading then you have a good thing in front of you.</p>

        <p>The communities you do not want are those which wrap around a topic or teach a framework.</p>

        <p>Those are often lackluster, boring and decentralized with no real leadership.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>
