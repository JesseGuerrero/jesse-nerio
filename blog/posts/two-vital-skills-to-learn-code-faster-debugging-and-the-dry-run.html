        <p>To code requires both debugging & dry running. To become proficient at these is to become proficient at coding. It is impossible to grow as a coder without growing aptitude in both these capabilities.</p>

        <p>They are abilities that require repetition & progressive complexity.</p>

        <p>Your goal as a coder should always be to grow in these two abilities.</p>

        <h2>What Is Dry Running?</h2>

        <p>When you read code, you are dry running.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Blaz Photo</p>

        <p>Dry running is the act of behaving like the compiler and imagining code running as you read it.</p>

        <p>It is to imagine the logic of the code, holding variables in your mind and running top down through source code.</p>

        <p>Often, many people say "my mind doesn't work that way", or "I can't code myself out of a paper bag".</p>

        <p>The idea that the mind is static and cannot improve in imagining code is a common misconception.</p>

        <p>The truth is, the average human cannot dry run code at the beginning of their adventure.</p>

        <p>Dry running is an aptitude which <em>must be improved</em>.</p>

        <p>There is an adaptation of the mind that happens as you code and read code.</p>

        <p>The speed and starting point of this adaptation is different per person.</p>

        <p>Only seek to improve yourself. Don't look at others. Believe you can do it.</p>

        <p>Just read your code and imagine the logic in your mind.</p>

        <p>As you do, your mind will adapt in time.</p>

        <p>Often, dry running is the missing key that stops a coder from progressing.</p>

        <p>They get caught up in the genius of another. Don't do that, just focus on improving.</p>

        <p>At first you won't be able to run a function or loop in your imagination. Perhaps you can do 2 or 3 lines of a function or loop.</p>

        <p>As your dry running ability improves with usage, you can eventually do 5 lines and 1 variable.</p>

        <p>Eventually you can do 10 lines, 1 loop and 1 variable.</p>

        <p>Then a year later 25 lines, 2 loops, 1 function and 2 variables all in your imagination.</p>

        <p>Heck in 5 years you can probably do 50 lines!</p>

        <p>Dry running is a cognitive facility.</p>

        <p>Cognitive facilities improve with usage and progressive complexity.</p>

        <p>By improving your dry running aptitude you widen your capability to imagine code.</p>

        <p>This is an essential skill in programming.</p>

        <h2>How do you practice dry running?</h2>

        <p>The first and foremost way to improve your dry running ability is to write and read code.</p>

        <p>As you do so, over time your mind naturally adapts.</p>

        <p>You can use debugging tools and print lines to assist you.</p>

        <p>But, your goal should always be to imagine code.</p>

        <p>A more direct approach, and this is a good way, is to practice competitive programming.</p>

        <p>The main purpose of competitive programming is to practice dry running.</p>

        <p>I wrote a guide to getting good at LeetCode, in case you wanted to delve into that.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Alexander Mils</p>

        <p>But, LeetCode or competitive programming centers around dry running. Debugging and other skills take a side line in that space.</p>

        <p>In technical interviews and competitive contests, it is standard practice to not even execute the program until after you have dry run the code and ironed out all the logic.</p>

        <p>The goal of solving problems on LeetCode is to know and write the solution while executing once at the end.</p>

        <p>Now, of course you fix up syntax issues when you execute the code but the logic is supposed to exist without printing lines or using a debugger.</p>

        <p>Code is all done first.</p>

        <p>You are the compiler in competitive programming.</p>

        <p>This is an excellent way to widen your ability to imagine code and many of us, me included, need this practice.</p>

        <h2>What Is Debugging?</h2>

        <p>Debugging is the core of programming. The act of debugging is the teacher of how to code.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Timothy Dykes</p>

        <p>Debugging is finding solutions to problems. Debugging is solution seeking as well as code congruence (making the logic of the code equal to the logic of your imagination).</p>

        <p>To imagine something and put it into a machine is done by solving 1,000 ways <em>not to do something</em> and 12 ways to do something and choosing the best way.</p>

        <p>It is a mass storage of problems and solutions which you gather over the years.</p>

        <p>Your progress and learning in debugging will drive your competency as a programmer.</p>

        <h2>How do you practice debugging?</h2>

        <p>You practice debugging by solving different technical problems over and over again, debugging.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Edge2Edge Media</p>

        <p>The more you solve the better coder/tech person you become.</p>

        <p>Many people avoid this. They see it as a chore or something painful.</p>

        <p>This is what makes the difference between a programmer and a non-programmer.</p>

        <p>A programmer loves the battle, loves debugging problems.</p>

        <p>They thrive on it. They know their aptitude for that technology will improve as they amass the knowledge of doing things.</p>

        <p>Others, just want to get it over with. They want the solution, not the problem.</p>

        <p>If you can come to love debugging and commit to it every day, your understanding/code skill as a programmer will improve.</p>

        <p>You need this to learn programming at a higher level.</p>

        <h2>Debugging vs Dry Running</h2>

        <p>One is a cognitive facility and the other mass storage.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Fly</p>

        <p>These abilities are the keys to the kingdom. They unlock a potential hidden to those who claim, "I can't code myself out of a paper bag".</p>

        <p>If dry running is to imagine code, debugging is to facilitate it.</p>

        <p>You need to both be able to implement and imagine, in no particular order.</p>

        <p>Through time and implementation, these improve and you can finally be an epic coder...</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
