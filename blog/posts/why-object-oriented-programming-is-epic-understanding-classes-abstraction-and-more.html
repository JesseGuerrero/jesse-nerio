    <article class="content">
        <p>Object oriented programming (OOP for short) is a style of code design.</p>

        <p>It tells the programmer how to structure his code.</p>

        <p>Like OOP there are other styles of code design, such as these:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Functional programming</li>
            <li>Modular programming</li>
            <li>Imperative programming</li>
            <li>Declarative programming</li>
            <li>Logical programming</li>
            <li>And more...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>But unlike these other code styles, OOP is the most widely used and well known among developers.</p>

        <p>It is considered an essential code style to learn.</p>

        <h2>What is an object?</h2>

        <p>Objects are the center of OOP.</p>

        <p>The purpose of objects is to take something really specific and make it super generalized.</p>

        <p>Lets take a look at one thing to generalize...</p>

<pre>public class Coordinate {
    private double x;
    private double y;
    private double z;

    public Coordinate(double x, double y, double z) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.z = z;
    }

    public double distanceTo(Coordinate other) { //Built-in function
        double dx = this.x - other.x;
        double dy = this.y - other.y;
        double dz = this.z - other.z;
        return Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy + dz * dz);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Coordinate point1 = new Coordinate(1.0, 2.0, 3.0);
        Coordinate point2 = new Coordinate(4.0, 5.0, 6.0);
        double distance = point1.distanceTo(point2)
        System.out.println("Distance is " + distance);
    }
}</pre>

        <p>Notice how Coordinate takes something specific, x, y, z.</p>

        <p>It then generalizes it as a coordinate.</p>

        <p>In addition you have a built-in function, "distanceTo", which uses the Pythagorean theorem to show distance.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-object-oriented-programming-is-epic--understanding-classes,-abstraction,-and-more---img-0.jpeg" alt="Pythagorean theorem illustration">

        <p>This generalization is known as "Abstraction".</p>

        <p>We are abstracting x, y, z to coordinate.</p>

        <p>Why?</p>

        <p>Abstraction allows code to be re-used in a readable and understandable way.</p>

        <p>Manipulating a Coordinate class is much easier than manipulating x, y, z in lets say a "Player" class.</p>

        <p>Look at this...</p>

<pre>public class Player {
    private Coordinate coordinate;
    private Bank bank;
    private String username;

    public Player(String name) {
        this.username = name;
        this.coordinate = new Coordinate(0, 0, 0);
        this.bank = new Bank();
    }
}</pre>

        <p>Notice how we have two abstractions called Coordinate and Bank. These are "Objects" or generalizations if you will.</p>

        <p>Now lets look at the same code without abstraction...</p>

<pre>public class Player {
    private double x;
    private double y;
    private double z
    private int[][] bankedItems;
    private int[][] isNotedItem
    private String bankPin;

    private String username;

    public Player(String name) {
        this.username = name;
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
        this.z = 0;
        this.bankedItems = new int[10][10];
        this.isNotedItem = new int[10][10];
        this.bankPin = "";
    }
}</pre>

        <p>Notice how I have to get very specific.</p>

        <p>I am using more variables and at first glace it is difficult to really understand what is going on.</p>

        <p>All those "int[][]" and "x, y, z" can be placed safely inside Coordinate and Bank without any fear of confusing the reader.</p>

        <h2>How classes are structured</h2>

        <p>We call these abstractions "classes".</p>

        <p>These are a custom variable that abstracts other variables.</p>

        <p>What is crazy, you can place a custom variable within a custom variable.</p>

        <p>This is like that player class. Look at it again...</p>

<pre>public class Player {
    private Coordinate coordinate;
    private Bank bank;
//...
}</pre>

        <p>Those are custom variables within your custom variable.</p>

        <p>Pretty cool right?</p>

        <p>Classes are objects, classes are abstractions, classes are custom variables.</p>

        <p>It is a way of structuring memory for the developer.</p>

        <p>We allocate x, y, z as integers in computer memory then create a custom variable for it.</p>

        <p>When we create the custom variable there are 4 types of data we can put inside...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Inner variables</li>
            <li>Inner functions</li>
            <li>A constructor</li>
            <li>Magic functions</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These hold data into memory in a way the developer can understand, once learned.</p>

        <p>Read through this code again, I will mark the types of inner memory as comments.</p>

<pre>public class Player {
    //Inner variable
    private Coordinate coordinate;
    private Bank bank;
    private String username;

    //Constructor
    public Player(String name) {
        this.username = name;
        this.coordinate = new Coordinate(0, 0, 0);
        this.bank = new Bank();
    }

    // Inner function
    public changeUsername(String name) {
        this.username = name;
    }

    // Magic function
    public toString() {
        return "Player " + username;
    }
}</pre>

        <p>Okay, lets go from top to bottom.</p>

        <p><strong>Inner variables</strong> are the custom variables within your custom variables</p>

        <p><strong>The constructor</strong> tells you how to create your class as a variable.</p>

        <p><strong>The inner function</strong> is only usable from within that player.</p>

        <p><strong>Magic functions</strong> are called "magic" because the language takes these functions and uses them in some way.</p>

        <p>Magic in programming means something that is taken away from the developer.</p>

        <p>Magic works in the background without us really knowing what is happening, thus it is magical.</p>

        <p>When you print the player the language magically converts it "toString"...</p>

<pre>Player player = new Player("Jesse");
System.out.print(player);
//Output -> "Player Jesse"</pre>

        <p>There are many many magic functions in all languages.</p>

        <p>You basically have to look each one up because they are all different.</p>

        <h2>You can use other classes</h2>

        <p>Inheritance is a way to take a class and give it more details.</p>

        <p>When we obtain all the data of another class as lets say a different abstraction, it is known as inheritance.</p>

        <p>Lets look at our Player example...</p>

<pre>class Entity {
    private Coordinate coordinate;
    private int hitpoints;

    public Entity() {
        this.coordinate = new Coordinate(0, 0, 0);
        this.hitpoints = 10;
    }

    public toString() {
        return "Entity has hitpoints: " + hitpoints.toString();
    }
}

public class Player extends Entity {
    private Bank bank;
    private String username;

    public Player(String name) {
        super(); //Calls Entity constructor
        this.username = name;
        this.bank = new Bank();
    }

    public changeUsername(String name) {
        this.username = name;
    }
}</pre>

        <p>In here we extend or give further detail to Entity.</p>

        <p>Player absorbs everything from Entity, including the functions, constructor and magic functions.</p>

        <p>Player then will have 10 hit points, coordinate 0, 0, 0 and will print "Entity has hit points: 10".</p>

<pre>Player player = new Player("Jesse");
System.out.print(player)
// Output: "Entity has hitpoints: 10"</pre>

        <h2>When making classes you get free data</h2>

        <p>For all your custom variables you get free inner variables, functions, constructor and magic functions.</p>

        <p>These form a core of every class for how it is stored in memory.</p>

        <p>This is something that the language itself does.</p>

        <p>No matter what you do your class will extend or inherit from a class called "Object".</p>

        <p>This is the way it looks...</p>

<pre>public class Object {
    @IntrinsicCandidate
    public Object() {}

    @IntrinsicCandidate
    public final native Class&lt;?&gt; getClass();

    @IntrinsicCandidate
    protected native Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException;

    public String toString() {
        return getClass().getName() + "@" + Integer.toHexString(hashCode());
    }
    //More built-in Functions
}</pre>

        <p>So in reality when we create a class it is actually this...</p>

<pre>public Coordinate extends Object {
    double x;
    double y;
    double z;
    //Etc.
}</pre>

        <p>However in most to all languages we do not add the "extends Object".</p>

        <p>We just magically know it inherits from Object.</p>

        <p>You can check out the Object class in Java if you look inside the language code.</p>

        <p>It is quite huge and structures all classes the same way.</p>

        <h2>All Objects are based on primitives</h2>

        <p>Primitives are considered the lowest built-in variables types in a language.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-object-oriented-programming-is-epic--understanding-classes,-abstraction,-and-more---img-1.png" alt="Primitives illustration">

        <p>All Objects are based on them.</p>

        <p>All abstractions are based on them.</p>

        <p>In a Coordinate class (like a video game) we can use three double primitives, x, y, z.</p>

        <p><strong>When creating new classes without depending on other classes, we <em>have</em> to use primitives.</strong></p>

        <p>Literally nothing else exists.</p>

        <p>Classes are then abstractions of abstractions of primitives.</p>

        <h2>For classes there is a creator and consumer</h2>

        <p>When a coder creates a class they design it in a way to be used.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-object-oriented-programming-is-epic--understanding-classes,-abstraction,-and-more---img-2.png" alt="Creator and consumer illustration">

        <p>The class itself is an interface, almost like an API, between the consuming developer and the primitives inside the class.</p>

        <p>For example let us say the original creator of the Player class made it 5 years ago.</p>

        <p>That creator intended the class to be used in a specific way.</p>

        <p>They defined the magic, inner variable/functions and constructor.</p>

        <p>If that Player class has been made standard in the source other developers are not meant to touch that class.</p>

        <p>We are meant to <em>use</em> that class or consume it.</p>

        <p>But, we are not meant to edit that class.</p>

        <p>When you start on a new project with other developers you become a consumer of all the objects which are standard.</p>

        <p>If you create a new standard, other developers become your consumers and vice versa.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-object-oriented-programming-is-epic--understanding-classes,-abstraction,-and-more---img-3.jpeg" alt="Blacksmith crafting">

        <p>Think of the class design like using an API.</p>

        <h2>The 4 pillars of OOP</h2>

        <p>This is something you always learn in Computer Science 1 or Computer Science 2 college courses.</p>

        <p>Very academic.</p>

        <p>You can naturally pick up on this while you learn coding but its better to explain.</p>

        <h2>Abstraction</h2>

        <p>Abstraction is a generalization of a custom variable from other variables and primitives.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-object-oriented-programming-is-epic--understanding-classes,-abstraction,-and-more---img-4.png" alt="Abstraction illustration">

        <p>It is the whole goal of OOP.</p>

        <p>Abstraction is meant to make reading and writing code easier for the developer.</p>

        <h2>Encapsulation</h2>

        <p>Encapsulation is another word for putting inner variables within variables.</p>

        <p>This is known as <em>wrapping</em>.</p>

        <p>Wrapping like putting candy inside a paper container.</p>

        <p>We are <em>wrapping</em> primitives and making them abstract.</p>

        <p>Another word you hear about encapsulation is <em>hiding</em>.</p>

        <p>Hiding means calling an inner variable "private" and not allowing other developers to use it.</p>

        <p>As a class creator, hiding inner variables and functions from developers is essential for their consumption.</p>

        <h2>Inheritance</h2>

        <p>Inheritance means using the inner functions, inner variables, constructors, inner magic in a different class.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-object-oriented-programming-is-epic--understanding-classes,-abstraction,-and-more---img-5.png" alt="Inheritance illustration">

        <p>When one class inherits another, it is known as a child-parent relationship.</p>

        <p>The child inherits from the parent all its inner workings.</p>

        <p>The flexibility this allows in abstraction is amazing.</p>

        <p>You would be surprised how easy this makes code to read.</p>

        <h2>Polymorphism</h2>

        <p>Polymorphism is where we inherit multiple classes to define one custom variable.</p>

        <p>Here is an example...</p>

<pre>Player player = new Player("Jesse");
Entity entity = (Entity) player;
System.out.print(entity);
// Output: entity.toString() magic function</pre>

        <p>Here we are converting Player into its parent class Entity.</p>

        <p>This conversion is polymorphism or the ability to turn a class into another.</p>

        <p>This can also be done with interface classes which we wont get into.</p>

        <h2>Should I use Object Oriented Programming?</h2>

        <p>The use of OOP depends on the language, personal preference and project requirements.</p>

        <p>If you need a highly threaded mega optimized project, for example, then you would use functional programming.</p>

        <p>If you are making an API which requires no generalizations you can use a procedural approach.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-object-oriented-programming-is-epic--understanding-classes,-abstraction,-and-more---img-6.png" alt="Team discussion">

        <p>Some people are just addicted to OOP and want to use it for everything.</p>

        <p>That is okay too! Very controversial.</p>

        <p>As of now Java forces you to use classes/OOP in all of its programming.</p>

        <p>Yes you can do procedural programming, but technically you have to use classes up until Java 21.</p>

        <p>In the next few versions Java can be written without classes, making Java finally have the option to truly program without OOP.</p>

        <p>In the end its up to the team.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>
