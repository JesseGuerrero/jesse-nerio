    <article class="content">
        <p>Your first concern with learning to program should be to have the right motivation.</p>

        <p>Always showing up and grinding daily should be your motto if you really want to see results.</p>

        <p>Managing your motivation for the long-term is the singular most important thing you can do to learn to code.</p>

        <p>You should be coding... every day.</p>

        <p>The truth of the matter is length of time learning is the most significant statistic in learning to program.</p>

        <p>It takes 100s of hours of learning just to get down the basics and hundreds more to learn a language well, possible 1000s.</p>

        <p>It is the path everyone must take.</p>

        <p>Take it or leave it, that is how its done.</p>

        <h2>Manage your motivation</h2>

        <p>I personally find two viable long term reasons to code. One, to have fun, and two, to become a better human.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-0.jpeg" alt="Always be coding">

        <p>You will find as you learn to code your general proficiency with technology itself improves significantly.</p>

        <p>You will come to understand most to all apps better and better as you learning computer science AKA programming.</p>

        <h2>Making money is not a good motivation</h2>

        <p>Perhaps only in America, learning to code for a software engineering job just is not viable anymore.</p>

        <p>Jobs are highly gate-kept and flooded with programmers looking for a salary.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-1.jpeg" alt="Overpopulation image">

        <p>In America, even those with experience and seniority are having difficulty finding programming jobs here in 2024.</p>

        <p>Perhaps if the market in this country changes this motivation can become viable.</p>

        <p>At this time if you look at YouTube videos on software engineering jobs, you can look at the comments.</p>

        <p>There are many, many, people saying they are applying at 1,500+ jobs and still not getting any software engineering work.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-2.png" alt="Job market illustration">

        <p>This is just the state of things right now.</p>

        <p>If you live in India, China or other countries this motivation is more viable.</p>

        <p>Often in these countries you can land a job after as little as 15 applications.</p>

        <p>In the U.S a more sustainable reason is instead fun and self-improvement.</p>

        <p>Your goal should be to learn over time.</p>

        <p>More time learning = results. That is the key.</p>

        <h2>Determine your learning type</h2>

        <p>In using this time wisely, it is massively important to determine how you naturally learn.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-3.png" alt="Style">

        <p>Learning in sync with your natural style requires less motivation and can be way more sustainable.</p>

        <p>It can make or break you as a coder.</p>

        <h2>What happens outside your style?</h2>

        <p>In the past I tried programming many times but failed to catch on even to basic code.</p>

        <p>In my teens I was placed in front of code and asked to read it.</p>

        <p>That failed.</p>

        <p>I was told to simply write code, that failed.</p>

        <p>I took some courses in college in my early twenties and of course that failed (it was a senior level class and I knew nothing of programming)</p>

        <p>I never took a real entry level Computer science course and just assumed I sucked at coding.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-4.png" alt="Classroom">

        <p>At 27 I took my first actual entry level Computer Science class.</p>

        <p>The course was an "Introduction to computing" where I was taught what a variable was, loops, conditionals and all super entry level stuff.</p>

        <p>I knew none of that and it always seemed too hard to learn in the first place.</p>

        <p>This college style of learning from a lecture on theory just took.</p>

        <p>I needed to learn the basics in the theoretical style.</p>

        <p>For the first time I was learning.</p>

        <p>I was learning successfully in my learning style.</p>

        <p>Ever since then I stuck to that style and never stopped.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-5.png" alt="Theoretical learning">

        <p>Me, personally, I am a theoretical learner.</p>

        <p>I can watch and read theory for a few hours and actually improve as a coder.</p>

        <p>When I tell people my learning style, often they are surprised.</p>

        <p>It seems strange.</p>

        <p>I can read theoretical blogs, watch a 1 hour lecture and then suddenly I am a better coder in that topic.</p>

        <p>If I figured that out much sooner it would have saved me a lot of hassle.</p>

        <h2>The learning styles</h2>

        <p>The only way to figure out your learning type is trying each one and seeing which works best.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-6.png" alt="Trial and error">

        <p>For your experimentation there a few distinct learning types out there...</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Theoretical learners</strong> (me): You must understand how the magic works to be able to code.</li>
            <li><strong>Readers</strong>: Everything has to be in written form</li>
            <li><strong>Watchers</strong>: You need visualization and code alongs</li>
            <li><strong>Coders</strong>: You can only code, but you are damn good</li>
            <li><strong>Documentation geeks</strong>: You can read documentation like a boss</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Try each one and see what takes.</p>

        <p>If you are beginner watch a Computer Science fundamentals course:</p>

        <p>Introduction to Programming and Computer Science - Full Course</p>

        <p>It might take, it might not take.</p>

        <p>If you are a <strong>theoretical learner</strong> like me, courses like these and Udemy are KING.</p>

        <p>I can listen to 8 hours on how a framework functions in the background then actually code that framework.</p>

        <p>But I cant look at code and figure it out nowhere near as easily.</p>

        <p>If you are a <strong>coder</strong> type you will find you can literally glance at code and your eyeballs just naturally understand.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-7.png" alt="Code on screen">

        <p>If you are a <strong>reader</strong> type you can take any blog, like mine, and learn at ultra speeds.</p>

        <p>Readers would be great at the Head First series on Amazon.</p>

        <p>If you are a <strong>watcher</strong> you will love code alongs and tutorial explanations. Some people thrive on code alongs, not a bad thing and not a myth.</p>

        <p><strong>Documentation geeks</strong> are amazing. They can look at a manual and just naturally take on the code.</p>

        <p>Other coders are often jealous of documentation geeks just for the fact documentation is usually the most up to date with a language/framework.</p>

        <p>Documentation geeks often are not theoretical learners yet understand and write code from the official coding manual.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-8.png" alt="Unity Documentation">

        <p>Pretty bonkers.</p>

        <h2>The more you learn in one style, the better</h2>

        <p>You should learn your strength and exploit it, for sure.</p>

        <p>But, all these learning styles are useful.</p>

        <p>The more you learn in one style, the better you get at that style.</p>

        <p>Over time as you read documentation, your ability to understand docs just improves.</p>

        <p>Same with theory and the coder style.</p>

        <p>The mind just naturally adapts to the style, being itself plastic.</p>

        <h2>Learn the fundamentals</h2>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-9.png" alt="Brain with ideas">

        <p>While managing your motivation and determining your learning style the order of learning to code should be</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Programming fundamentals and IDE (As much as you can)</li>
            <li>One language (For as long as you can)</li>
            <li>And lastly, a niche</li>
        </ol>

        <p>For programming fundamentals I have created blogs on several learning styles.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-get-a-coders-mindset--cultivating-passion-and-finding-your-learning-style---img-10.png" alt="Blog">

        <p>First, for the theoretical learner I recommend reading: <a href="why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-and-questions-you-should-be-asking.html">Why Coding Fundamentals Are Important & Questions You Should Be Asking</a></p>

        <p>Second, for the pure code learner I recommend: <a href="unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses.html">Unlock Your Potential With 5 Ways To Study Programming Without Tutorials or Courses</a></p>

        <p>And lastly for the video watcher I recommend: <a href="do-full-courses-really-help-you-become-a-great-coder.html">Do Full Courses Really Help You Become a Great Coder?</a></p>

        <p>Each says the same thing but in different styles.</p>

        <p>Each of these are viable ways to learn the programming fundamentals.</p>

        <p>Learn the fundamentals and stick to one language and one niche.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>
