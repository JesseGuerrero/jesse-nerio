    <article class="content">
        <p>This full course on AWS is meant to give you a true understanding of the cloud system while preparing you for the Cloud Practitioner exam.</p>

        <p>When finishing this course I honestly felt much more confident and capable of creating scalable applications on Amazon Web Services.</p>

        <p>I am pleasantly surprised with how useful and powerful is AWS. With the right knowledge and skills we can create entire enterprises pretty quickly.</p>

        <p>This course focuses on the actual systems & automations of AWS and less on code.</p>

        <p>And while it is good and possible to create applications more or less only using AWS, code itself is irreplaceable.</p>

        <p>With the course author Stephane Maarek you will not find yourself writing any code.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the most difficult part of AWS is integrating code and AWS automation properly.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-0.jpeg" alt="Photo by Marc Mueller">

        <p>This is only made possible by knowing both the AWS system really well and being able to write advanced code at the same time.</p>

        <p>While Stephane does not cover coding, the knowledge of AWS will be highly useful to you.</p>

        <p>As you grow as a coder you will find AWS is a wonderful addition to your skillset.</p>

        <h2>After the course I was still not ready for the exam</h2>

        <p>During the course I focused on learning AWS, not passing the exam.</p>

        <p>I think this is the best way to learn AWS. To learn AWS well and not just pass the exam.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-1.png" alt="Travis Media YouTube review of AWS">

        <p>Travis Media in his YouTube review of AWS states many hiring managers and senior developers don't particularly like Cloud certifications.</p>

        <p>They believe it puffs up new developers and gives new developers the sense they know more than they actually do.</p>

        <p>The concern is they memorized how to pass the exam and did not actually come to understand AWS.</p>

        <p>I can see this argument and I agree.</p>

        <p>If we take a course on AWS just to pass the exam and come to memorize lists of concepts just for the sake of passing, we will fall into this stereotype.</p>

        <p>In his YouTube video Travis concludes we absolutely benefit from having a certificate and advises new coders should still get the certificate.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-2.jpeg" alt="Photo by Compare Fibre">

        <p>As we follow and complete a course we should not just pass the exam but truly learn AWS systems as well as possible.</p>

        <h2>It took me a while...</h2>

        <p>It took me 5 months off and on to finish this course.</p>

        <p>The best and more fun part were the hands on portions of the Udemy course.</p>

        <p>The first half included a lot of hands on.</p>

        <p>But, when I started the second half I found myself often getting bored and having a hard time concentrating.</p>

        <p>Stephane did not do as much hands on in the second half and I found myself taking week long breaks due to boredom.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-3.png" alt="Back-End Developer job posting">

        <p>During this time while applying to jobs, I saw many job descriptions requiring AWS certifications for junior positions I wanted.</p>

        <p>Eventually I got fed up applying for jobs without having the certification and started to hunker down and go through the second half, despite the lack of hands on.</p>

        <p>I started taking notes and often used them to review during lectures.</p>

        <p>When I finally finished the course I took the end practice exam bombed it with a 54% out of 100.</p>

        <p>Thoroughly, I was disappointed with the results.</p>

        <p>I still felt I knew AWS very well at this point but my learning was simply not optimized for the exam.</p>

        <h2>I still need Whizlabs</h2>

        <p>Travis Media expressed the same sentiment in his AWS videos.</p>

        <p>He also bombed the practice exams after finishing his Udemy course but felt he learned AWS very well.</p>

        <p>To remediate this he recommends Whizlabs after the course...</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-4.png" alt="Whizlabs website">

        <p>According to Travis, Whizlabs is a standard study tool for many certification exams and comes at a very cheap price.</p>

        <p>They give many practice exams often with 1/4 coupons and discounts.</p>

        <p>Now, after finishing the Udemy course I am practicing with Whiz labs and improving my scores with every practice exam.</p>

        <p>With the platform I was able to get 8 practice exams and a topic focused series of videos for $17.</p>

        <p>The focus of Whizlabs is to simply pass the exam.</p>

        <p>Very much worth it in my opinion.</p>

        <p>The Udemy course was more for learning AWS and Whizlabs was more for passing the exam.</p>

        <p>I believe it is best to have both.</p>

        <h2>I could not make projects until the second half</h2>

        <p>Perhaps the most difficult part of getting to the second half of the Udemy course was how expensive AWS seemed.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-5.jpeg" alt="Photo by Ibrahim Rifath">

        <p>I would often think of great projects for AWS but felt I could not implement them due to pricing.</p>

        <p>Without some framework for estimating pricing ahead of time I could not implement projects due to fear of cost.</p>

        <p>I remember starting out several years ago.</p>

        <p>I created a simple website over AWS and 2 weeks later was charged $17 for literally doing <em>nothing</em>.</p>

        <p>I had no idea where the charge was coming from and I absolutely dreaded AWS for any personal project.</p>

        <p>Once ever 1 or 2 years I would try to make a project on AWS and would get charged these seemingly random amounts.</p>

        <p>At the time I concluded AWS was a terrible platform to get started and stayed away from it.</p>

        <h2>The billing section</h2>

        <p>It wasn't until I got to the billing section of the course in the second half that I finally received a framework for truly choosing the cheapest methods for using AWS.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-6.png" alt="AWS Services list">

        <p>After the billing section I created a small application using AWS automation and was able to know with certainty my application would cost mere cents per millions of requests.</p>

        <p>This was what I needed to know.</p>

        <p>After all these years, I finally can use AWS in my personal projects.</p>

        <p>The reason Stephane saved the billing and pricing section for the second half was because we need to know most of the services and principles of cloud systems before a pricing framework would make sense.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-7.png" alt="HTTP APIs cost estimator">

        <p>We basically use a cost estimator and put together a bunch of services and their usage to estimate an overall cost on our account.</p>

        <p>But, how can we predict pricing if we don't know what the individual automations do or how they work?</p>

        <p>Now, with this new found knowledge, I can finally estimate every project I make with a list of services <em>before</em> even coding it up.</p>

        <h2>You can do most things through the free tier</h2>

        <p>If done properly you can finish most things through the free tier on AWS.</p>

        <p>It lasts a year and gives you a starting usage balance with many services.</p>

        <p>You can get a free tiny virtual machine instance for about a year and many other services come with free usage.</p>

        <p>I feel it is enough to learn with for both the cloud practitioner and architect exams.</p>

        <p>It is also enough for personal projects.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-8.png" alt="AWS Free Tier">

        <p>I have also found it possible to restart the free tier with a new Amazon account. Though I don't know if that will be possible in the future.</p>

        <p>If, after some time you run out of the free tier you may be able to just re-register under a new email.</p>

        <p>For just personal projects, after the billing section of the Udemy course it is possible to make mostly anything without worry of being over charged.</p>

        <p>The biggest issue with the cost estimator service with AWS is you don't know what you know.</p>

        <p>The cost estimator gives you an assortment of services you can use and scaling costs based on the values you put into it.</p>

        <p>Its seemingly impossible to figure out without actually knowing how AWS works and how each of the services works.</p>

        <p>Even without the free tier, if this cost estimator is used properly you should find yourself spending under $5 per month for good sized personal projects.</p>

        <p>Perhaps the only fear I have with this is making public end points and some malicious user spamming my endpoint to make my AWS service begin costing money.</p>

        <h2>Which certification is best to start?</h2>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-9.jpeg" alt="AWS Certifications chart">

        <p>There are 12 AWS certifications you can get.</p>

        <p>Foundational is the easiest and associate, professional and specialty are more difficult.</p>

        <p>If this is your first cloud system and/or you are a new coder, I recommend Cloud Practitioner.</p>

        <p>Many YouTube influencers talking about cloud systems will tell you the foundational certification is not a real competitive certification for employment.</p>

        <p>They say it is just a start and we should get at least the Associate level.</p>

        <p>Often they recommend Architect and say this is the actual starting certification.</p>

        <p>In addition you can get the Architect Associate certification and skip Cloud Practitioner all together.</p>

        <img src="../images/full-course-review--ultimate-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-clf-c02---img-10.jpeg" alt="Photo by Unseen Studio">

        <p>But, I have found the Architect Associate exam is very very difficult.</p>

        <p>Since I have never learned a cloud system, I had to learn everything from the foundation.</p>

        <p>Me, personally, Cloud practitioner was tough enough as is.</p>

        <p>I would rather start with something foundational and just get the entry certification then afterward go associate.</p>

        <p>The Udemy course author, Stephane, says this in his course and I feel this is good advice.</p>

        <p>But, if you are already an advanced user of cloud systems you may find the architect certification is more suitable.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
