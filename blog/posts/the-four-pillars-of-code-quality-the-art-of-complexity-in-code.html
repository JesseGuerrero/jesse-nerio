        <h1>The Four Pillars of Code Quality: The Art of Complexity in Code</h1>
        <div class="meta"></div>
    </header>

    <article class="content">
        <p>Complexity estimation is an essential tool to writing good code.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of all Computer Science university programs one of the first things we learn is complexity.</p>

        <p>Why is it so important?</p>

        <p>Why would every course in university focus on this concept?</p>

        <p>I mean it is not even coding.</p>

        <p>But wait a minute here, don't go. If you hear a lecture on this topic or know nothing about it, listen and learn about complexity.</p>

        <p>Complexity forms the basis of good code.</p>

        <p>I would say there are 4 types of complexity to consider..</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Legibility of code (is it maintainable?)</li>
            <li>Code size (is it a lot of code?)</li>
            <li>Space complexity(How much memory?)</li>
            <li>Time complexity (How long will it take)</li>
        </ol>

        <p>As a developer we are master craftsmen. Our entire goal should be to refine these 4 dimensions of code.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-0.jpeg" alt="Photo by Luke Chesser">

        <p>These metrics define how good of a programmer you are.</p>

        <p>Can you consistently create code with optimal complexity?</p>

        <p>Is your solution exactly what you set out to do while keeping these 4 principles?</p>

        <p>What makes an advanced developer advanced is their ability to create the right solution in optimal complexity in large quantities.</p>

        <p>The end goal is Quality X Quantity.</p>

        <h2>Legibility of code</h2>

        <p>Computer Science programs tend to skip the first two types of complexity; maintainability/legibility and code size.</p>

        <p>They hyper focus on space and time.</p>

        <p>This is a bit of a shame, as we need to talk about principles of clean code. What creates maintainability and how verbosity decreases as you advance.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-1.jpeg" alt="Photo by Markus Spiske">

        <p>Illegibility and large code sizes are traits of beginner programmers.</p>

        <p>As you become a better programmer the amount of code you produce, the legibility of the code and smaller code sizes improve.</p>

        <p>There are 3 ways to get cleaner code, they are (in order of importance):</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Write code</li>
            <li>Rewrite code</li>
            <li>Learn clean code principles</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Books like <em>clean code</em> by Robert Martin, Udemy courses on writing clean code are great.</p>

        <p>But nothing beats simply writing code.</p>

        <p>Time under writing code is the greatest way to make you a cleaner coder.</p>

        <p>It has to be intentional. As you write you must be thinking, what is the most maintainable way to do this?</p>

        <p>Refactoring AKA rewriting your code periodically is a major part of writing clean.</p>

        <p>Clean code principles are essential as well.</p>

        <p>All three ways I mentioned are essential for your optimal growth in creating clean code.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-2.jpeg" alt="Number 3">

        <p>I would always recommend once you get a a year of writing/rewriting code, you should learn clean code principles.</p>

        <p>Once you hear some principles, it should become intentional. The best way to learn them is to reflect on how to use them in all of your programming.</p>

        <p>For example, <em>code in the affirmative</em> is a principle of using if statements. Take a look...</p>

<pre><code>if(condition == true) # affirmative
    doSomething();
else
    doSomethingElse();

if(condition != true) # Not affirmative
    doSomethingElse();
else
    doSomething();</code></pre>

        <p>The top condition is an affirmative statement, we are checking if something is true.</p>

        <p>The general statement is to put all your true conditions at the top of your if statements.</p>

        <p>When you hear this in a lecture or Udemy course, you should intentionally reflect on how you write code.</p>

        <p>Then, while writing code you should ingrain that principle into all of your writing.</p>

        <p>Clean code principles are best learned through placing it into the muscle memory of your code writing.</p>

        <p>Another principle is <em>avoid else statements where possible</em>. Let's try to make that a habit, like this:</p>

<pre><code>if(condition == true) {
    doSomething();
    return;
}
doSomethingElse();</code></pre>

        <p>According to Robert Martin and those clean code gurus on YouTube, this example would be considered a more legible statement.</p>

        <p>Once you hear a principle you add it to all your implementation and follow through.</p>

        <p>It is deliberate inclusion as you write from the start of hearing the principle.</p>

        <p>And yes, the uninitiated to clean code principles will criticize your code.</p>

        <p>I have had people criticize my code because I didn't "use all the functions of the language" like else statements, adding too much abstraction or removing nesting (another principle).</p>

        <p>What was absolutely hilarious, as they were criticizing my code they knew exactly what every part of my code was about and why I put it there.</p>

        <p>I sat silent, let them finish and gladly noticed they had no problem reading it.</p>

        <p>I remember the days when no one could read my code. And now, even in criticism coders know exactly what I am writing by just looking at it.</p>

        <p>Here are two great series for learning clean principles and then afterward intentionally applying them.</p>

        <p>I recommend watching these and keeping notes on clean code in a note taking app like Codex, referring and intentionally adding them to your writings.</p>

        <p>The majority of readers of your code will thank you...</p>

        <h2>Code size</h2>

        <p>There is an ironic trend to code size and advancement as a coder.</p>

        <p>Beginner programmers tend to write the most complex and largest code bases.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-3.jpeg" alt="Photo by Umberto">

        <p>Most people will think the large code size and complexity is a trademark of an advanced developer.</p>

        <p>Quite the contrary.</p>

        <p>They look at the simple solution and think the developer was a beginner.</p>

        <p>The truth is the most advanced programmers tend to write the most simple and small but effective code bases.</p>

        <p>The beginner and advanced coder will come up with a similar solution.</p>

        <p>But looking at the code we see a huge difference.</p>

        <p>To be fair, I am a bit ecumenical about clean code and code size.</p>

        <p>I am in favor of writing dirty at the beginning of your programming journey.</p>

        <p>There is no other way to write when you first start.</p>

        <p>The principles of clean code and code size are out of your reach until you understand coding in greater depth.</p>

        <p>And the fact of beginners being able to solve <em>any</em> problem at <em>any</em> complexity is the key sign of talent.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-4.jpeg" alt="Photo by Olav Rotne">

        <p>Anybody can clean up their code and reduce code size. It is a non-issue as it can be taught.</p>

        <p>It just takes principles and time under implementation.</p>

        <p>But, for your first year if you can solve difficult problems, no matter how complex the code, that is a key sign you have <em>raw talent</em> (as opposed to earned talent).</p>

        <p>The talent of a beginner developer is not measured in the complexity of his code, but their ability to solve problems <em>at all</em>.</p>

        <p>Perhaps one of the most talented developers I ever came across was the creator of what is known as the Matrix base in the RSPS (Runescape private servers) community.</p>

        <p>English was his second language, he was in his first few years of programming.</p>

        <p>He was able to reverse engineer the server (in a team) for the video game Runescape in a matter of months, learning sockets and principles of programming at the same time.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-5.png" alt="Video game Runescape">

        <p>But, by golly, was his complexity just horrendous.</p>

        <p>Everything was misspelled (he barely knew English), the code size was humongous with 1000s of lines per code file, nothing was legible and the time/space complexity was wack.</p>

        <p>But heck, I was able to start up the Runescape client and play the game just like the real one.</p>

        <p>Now that is <em>raw talent</em>. Just because a beginner is writing high complexity code doesn't mean they suck.</p>

        <p>Highly complex code is actually a requirement at those lower levels.</p>

        <p>You need to learn to do it <em>at all</em> first and foremost, then learn to do it clean.</p>

        <p>Years later he created Matrix Version 2 and Version 3 and more and more versions of Matrix. He got more and more prolific and cleaner with smaller code sizes.</p>

        <p>Anybody can hone their skill at complexity but <em>raw talent</em> is inherently what you are born with and that is the key sign.</p>

        <p>And just a qualifier here, raw talent is different than <em>earned talent</em>. Just because you don't start with raw talent doesn't mean you wont be able to catch up to someone like DragonKK (a Matrix creator) as is his online name.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-6.png" alt="Photo from WikiMedia">

        <p>When I mention raw talent I am talking about the first 3 months of programming. Beyond 3 months - 1 year you can start passing people up with raw talent with enough passion.</p>

        <p>But yes, your code size will naturally decrease as you create highly complex code then rewrite it.</p>

        <p>The fact you can write it at all is an indicator of talent, earned or raw.</p>

        <h2>How to produce more code</h2>

        <p>This is tricky. I will tell you the secret up front.</p>

        <p>The secret to producing massive amounts of code is to design how you will create the code before you do it.</p>

        <p>There are two ways this is done, either intuitively or by written design.</p>

        <h2>Intuitively</h2>

        <p>When we start programming this is our only option.</p>

        <p>We have to create or read the problem then envision the solution <em>as we write it</em>.</p>

        <p>The more advanced you are the farther ahead you can envision.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-7.jpeg" alt="Photo by Joe Holland">

        <p>Forecasting the entire code base ahead of time is the secret to producing massive quantities.</p>

        <p>The only way to forecast is to have done it before.</p>

        <p>Naturally as you solve more and more similar problems your forecasting ability will improve and naturally so will your output.</p>

        <p>If you get to a certain point you can begin to do an even greater thing than intuition.</p>

        <p>Something that will boost your output to even greater heights and that is writing a <em>system design</em>...</p>

        <h2>By system design</h2>

        <p>In backend development this is known as system design or code layout.</p>

        <p>In front end development it is known as a website design or mock up in a program like Figma.</p>

        <p>In graphics programming it is a write out of features and render design.</p>

        <p>In machine learning it is an architecture design and intended output.</p>

        <p>I took a bit of a stretch with graphics programming and machine learning. I am sure there is an actual official way to do code/model designs in those fields. But, I wanted to give you the general idea.</p>

        <p>The secret is to design how you are going to code it before you even touch the code.</p>

        <p>The entire code base should be visualized before you even write a function.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-8.jpeg" alt="Photo by Scott Graham">

        <p>This is the way its done at those much higher levels.</p>

        <p>It is what a code architect does.</p>

        <p>Here is the tricky part. You have to have intuitively coded something similar many times to really be able to do this.</p>

        <p>Using this GOAT method is like a chicken and egg problem.</p>

        <p>You need to design how you are going to write the code. But you need to have done it before.</p>

        <p>So, how in the world does that work?</p>

        <p>Well, you just start off by doing intuitively the first time. With that Matrix source I mentioned earlier DragonKK and the team of Matrix had to do it once.</p>

        <p>It was, for many on the team, the first computer networking code source they ever made.</p>

        <p>After doing it once they could see how to better make a system design.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-four-pillars-of-code-quality--the-art-of-complexity-in-code---img-9.png" alt="Example system design">

        <p>After doing it intuitively a few times they can outline the networking packets on something like <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw</a> for outlining, structure the layers of abstraction and create a general layout of the code source <em>before</em> even touching the code.</p>

        <p>You can spend an entire day making a system design for the whole app, then save weeks to months on actually writing the code.</p>

        <p>The fact that you know what you are writing before you write it is the big secret to writing enormous amounts of code.</p>

        <p>But when we first start we have to write intuitively. After some time we can start on designing the code base beforehand.</p>

        <p>Though in most cases we forecast intuitively, it will just depend on our ability to do that in the moment.</p>

        <p>With implementation it will naturally extend into the future.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
