        <p>For learning through pure implementation there is a barrier to entry.</p>

        <p>You need fundamentals.</p>

        <p>Pure implementative learning comes from reading code which already exists.</p>

        <p>Documentation describes that code, yes, but in the end you are looking at code.</p>

        <p>In addition you need to know enough of the language to understand at least a portion of the code you are reading.</p>

        <p>If you do not know what a function or a class is how can you read what a specific class or function does?</p>

        <p>This applies to many frameworks and code sources where the understanding we need for it requires some essential concept.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-0.jpeg" alt="Learning programming fundamentals">

        <p>If you are unsure of the fundamentals you can read my guide, do I know the fundamentals?</p>

        <p>But if you are past that, let us assume you know a good chunk of at least 1 language and have the fundamentals down.</p>

        <p>The question at this point is, how do I study languages and frameworks without courses?</p>

        <p>Sometimes there is no choice but to learn through implementation.</p>

        <p>And more, often it is better to focus purely on implementation and learn theory in the midst of coding.</p>

        <p>Lets talk about how to do that.</p>

        <h2>Use existing projects in your code</h2>

        <p>When we first start a language or framework we typically do not know what we do not know.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-1.jpeg" alt="Start Digital">

        <p>The cure for this is to either go through a full course on the topic and learn that way.</p>

        <p>Or, take existing code sources and use them as a template for ourselves while we implement code.</p>

        <p>Lets take OpenGL game engines as an example.</p>

        <h2>OpenGL example</h2>

        <p>OpenGL, like general programming, does require you to learn the fundamentals of graphics programming.</p>

        <p>This should be done with a full course just like learning a new language.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-2.png" alt="OpenGL Rotating Suzanne">

        <p>Here is my article on the beginning of OpenGL for you.</p>

        <p>But, once you are past the fundamentals of graphics programming you should be able to read OpenGL code and understand some parts.</p>

        <p>However, in the OpenGL ecosystem there are no full courses on learning OpenGL.</p>

        <p>There are, but they are too short, do not have homework and often have poor lectures.</p>

        <p>Without this luxury you are stuck doing only 1 thing, <em>implementive learning</em>.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-3.jpeg" alt="OpenGL code example">

        <p>This is the thing advanced programmers tout as the <em>only</em> best way to learn.</p>

        <p>Honestly, I doubt that.</p>

        <p>But often you have no choice but to learn this way.</p>

        <p>A great replacement in cases like these is to take a <em>starter project</em>.</p>

        <p>Open up your favorite open source website, look up your language and framework.</p>

        <p>Pick your language, like Python, your framework, like OpenGL, and sort by recently updated.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-4.png" alt="GitHub search for OpenGL projects">

        <p>You will see many projects in your niche.</p>

        <p>Pick one that is currently being updated and is relevant to you.</p>

        <p>Clone it into your computer and read through it.</p>

        <p>Is it useful?</p>

        <p>Does it run?</p>

        <p>Can I make a starter from this?</p>

        <p>If you answer yes to these then use it and build off of it.</p>

        <h2>Java Spring example</h2>

        <p>Another great example framework for implementive learning is Java Spring.</p>

        <p>This framework hardly has great <em>full courses</em>.</p>

        <p>You likely would find yourself stuck with implementive learning.</p>

        <p>Do the same thing as OpenGL...</p>

        <p>Search "java spring" on an open source website and sort by recently updated.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-5.png" alt="GitHub search for Java Spring projects">

        <p>You will find starter projects, templates and code sources for different purposes.</p>

        <p>Clone it and check it out.</p>

        <p>Is it relevant?</p>

        <p>Does it run?</p>

        <p>Can I make a starter from this?</p>

        <p>If you answer yes to these, then use it.</p>

        <h2>But, isn't using other people's code cheating?</h2>

        <p>Absolutely not.</p>

        <p>Big programming projects like Godot are known for using graphics programming techniques from other engines.</p>

        <p>They <em>rewrite</em> it of course, but they give credit and everybody celebrates the achievement.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-6.jpeg" alt="Collaboration in programming">

        <p>Often, software developers in other projects use other people's implementation anyway.</p>

        <p>I always hear my advanced coder friends say, "yea man, this other project had the logic I needed for my app".</p>

        <p>They copy the <em>logic</em> of someone else's code, cite the source and implement it in their project.</p>

        <p>It is what we do, it is called open source.</p>

        <p>Using <em>starter templates</em> is a virtue not a vice.</p>

        <p>It is good to always read other people's code in your niche so you can pick up on new logic.</p>

        <h2>Try to learn as many classes & functions as you can</h2>

        <p>Often what you find, the code you think is least important helps you the most in understanding a code source or framework.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-7.jpeg" alt="Studying code">

        <p>Start with those most used or most intriguing.</p>

        <p>But study with the intent of understanding the whole code source and third party libraries.</p>

        <h2>Go inside 3rd party library code</h2>

        <p>If I feel inclined to learning a framework while I am coding I go inside the class or function within the third party library.</p>

        <p>I read what the class is about, what classes or interfaces it inherits, and what the most commonly used functions actually do.</p>

        <p>It looks like this...</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-8.png" alt="Inside a third party Java library">

        <p>This is inside a third party Java library .jar.</p>

        <p>If you were in C++ you would go inside a header file or DLL.</p>

        <p>If you were in Python, you look inside the code through your pip environment.</p>

        <p>Often reading the contents of a 3rd party library is the best way to learn.</p>

        <h2>Use an LLM as a tutor</h2>

        <p>Copy and paste the third party code into an LLM.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-9.png" alt="ChatGPT interface">

        <p>Ask these questions,</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"Explain it like I am in 10th grade, what is this class for?"</li>
            <li>"What are the most commonly used functions?"</li>
            <li>"Explain the use cases for commonly used fields"</li>
            <li>"What other classes do I need to understand to grasp this class?"</li>
            <li>"Why does this framework use this class?"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Then try to understand the underlying principles of how that file fits into the framework.</p>

        <p>I do this for <em>every</em> class and function up to the point I understand why everything is put together in the code source.</p>

        <p>This is extremely valuable.</p>

        <p>This method of learning was literally not available before 2022, which is super cool.</p>

        <h2>Take notes on the framework and niche</h2>

        <p>No matter what you do, you will forget concepts and terminology.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-10.jpeg" alt="Taking notes">

        <p>It will be easier to learn the second time around.</p>

        <p>It will be even easier if you are the one teaching yourself in the future.</p>

        <p>I recommend taking notes with Codex.</p>

        <p>The goal of taking notes is to make your learning last longer than it would without it.</p>

        <p>Here is an example of some recent notes I took which should help me in the future...</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-11.png" alt="Codex notes example">

        <p>I organize it and write it down in a way I would understand and no one else.</p>

        <p>If you want to learn to do this well I wrote a quick guide on note taking with Codex.</p>

        <h2>Notetaking with private projects when you cannot add comments</h2>

        <p>This mostly applies to undocumented, unique private team projects where you are not allowed to use an LLM.</p>

        <p>LLMs record every piece of code you put into it.</p>

        <p>It then has the potential of leaking code to other developers whenever they ask about a similar topic.</p>

        <p>Because of this we often have to learn by asking other team members questions or reading about it ourselves.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-12.jpeg" alt="Team collaboration">

        <p>When we do so, it is very difficult to go back and forth from something like Codex back to our code source.</p>

        <p>A way more efficient method would be to add comments inside the project itself.</p>

        <p>The problem is, you are also not allowed to add comments to the code itself!</p>

        <p>So what do you do?</p>

        <p>How do I study a code source without going back and forth between Codex and the code?</p>

        <p>How do I readily understand the context of team code while I am reading it from understandings previously gained?</p>

        <p>Enter in-line note taking plugins.</p>

        <p>While you are studying a code source at say, work, or with a private project with friends you can take notes in-line.</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-13.png" alt="In-line note taking plugin">

        <p>Inside the code itself you can take notes and explain to yourself what this function or class does.</p>

        <p>Very handy for these type of projects.</p>

        <p>However, this does not really apply to public projects or those which you can use an LLM.</p>

        <p>Because with an LLM we are focusing more on conceptual learning Codex is better for public code sources.</p>

        <p>Private projects are so esoteric separate notetaking just becomes cumbersome and we need in-line notes to remediate knowledge.</p>

        <p>Here are two example plugins for in-line note taking</p>

        <p>Visual Studio Code: <!-- Link removed: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tkrkt.linenote returned HTTP 404 --></p>

        <p>JetBrains IDEs: <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17874-private-notes">https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17874-private-notes</a></p>

        <h2>Separate the coding process from the design process</h2>

        <p>Coding and designing <em>at the same time</em> is very difficult.</p>

        <p>Often we fall into this trap.</p>

        <p>When you first start an implementation project, the very first thing you must do is know what you are creating.</p>

        <p>What is something you can create within your technical ability?</p>

        <p>Write down a design, or a todo list of sorts.</p>

        <p>It can look something like this...</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-14.png" alt="README todo list example">

        <p>The goal is to have a loose TODO list so you are always guided.</p>

        <p>You want to code with the end in mind.</p>

        <p>All your code becomes more performant, cleaner and concise when you know what you are trying to make as you make it.</p>

        <p>All code is for one purpose, following your design.</p>

        <p>You can pick from the TODO and write it in how you feel best.</p>

        <p>In addition I pre-created a document format in MongoDB, like so...</p>

        <img src="../images/unlock-your-potential-with-5-ways-to-study-programming-without-tutorials-or-courses---img-15.png" alt="MongoDB document format example">

        <p>I used it as a guide for creating database queries.</p>

        <p>Stuff like that.</p>

        <p>Things you can guide ahead of time are...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Overall application goals</li>
            <li>Project features</li>
            <li>Website layout and design.</li>
            <li>Implementation logic</li>
            <li>Database schema</li>
            <li>Project structure</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The question you are trying to answer as best you can is, <em>what do I want to do?</em></p>

        <p>The idea is to plan out what you are going to code so you are not designing as well as coding at the same time.</p>

        <p>This way you separate design and coding.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
