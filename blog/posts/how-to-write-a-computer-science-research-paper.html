        <h1>How to Write a Computer Science Research Paper</h1>
        <div class="meta"></div>
    </header>

    <article class="content">
        <p>In the beginning a good chunk of this article will make sense.</p>

        <p>But there are many parts that become more helpful as you progress in your research journey.</p>

        <p>I have so much information in here that works when you first start, then works better once you have already started.</p>

        <p>This is one of those blog articles you read once when you start writing a research paper.</p>

        <p>Then read again after making a bunch of progress.</p>

        <p>So I recommend reading this now one time and then again some time later.</p>

        <h2>A college degree is not a requirement</h2>

        <p>At least in the computer science field, you do not need a college degree to publish to academic journals.</p>

        <p>Many people seek to publish research papers.</p>

        <p>It is a major flex and often required for specific jobs.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-0.png" alt="Google Scholar profile example">

        <p>As a professor or professional researcher, your Google Scholar profile, article and citation count are often like your portfolio.</p>

        <p>They show you truly are an expert and are at the edge of your field.</p>

        <p>In the academic world of professors and college grants publishing computer science research papers is a requirement.</p>

        <p>But as a computer science lover, you just require a love for your craft and research.</p>

        <p>There are many who publish many papers without entering the academic world and getting no formal degree.</p>

        <p>The main advantage you get from going to school and writing research papers in school is the authoritative backing of your professor for difficult publishers and the teaching of <em>how to write</em> a research paper.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-1.jpeg" alt="Research work">

        <p>Given you are a technically advanced person, you can publish without school. You just have to learn <em>how</em>.</p>

        <p>Let's say you are in a different boat.</p>

        <p>If you have no interest in writing research papers but you want to get a graduate degree in computer science, like a Masters or PhD. You will have to publish 3-5 research papers <em>before</em> they give you the degree.</p>

        <p>Some schools opt out of that for the Masters but for a PhD publishing is a <em>requirement</em>.</p>

        <p>Whether you are doing this grudgingly or eagerly I will give you some guidance on how it is done.</p>

        <p>Lets get into it...</p>

        <h2>Use Google Scholar for most of your research</h2>

        <p>There are many search engines out there for finding research papers.</p>

        <p>Some exist like...</p>

        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://paperswithcode.com/">https://paperswithcode.com/</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/">https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/</a></li>
            <li><a href="http://www.ojose.com/ojose_home.html">http://www.ojose.com/ojose_home.html</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.acm.org/publications">https://www.acm.org/publications</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/">https://www.sciencedirect.com/</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/periodicals/title">https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/browse/periodicals/title</a></li>
            <li>etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>And I do recommend using these. Especially Paperswithcode.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-2.png" alt="Papers With Code">

        <p>Paperswithcode is amazing for explaining difficult code implementations and many of the articles are not available on Google Scholar.</p>

        <p>In addition you can see direct examples of how to contribute code implementations as a research paper.</p>

        <p>But for the main meat of your research, Google Scholar combines all the above search engines and more.</p>

        <p>Then it shows them in a very intuitive fashion for readers.</p>

        <p>I also recommend making a profile and combining your Google Scholar research with a research paper manager like Mendeley.</p>

        <h2>Pick a topic, stick to it and read a lot</h2>

        <p>Pick a topic in computer science and read a lot.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-3.png" alt="Mendeley research manager">

        <p>Your goal when reading should be to find something that is missing.</p>

        <p>Something missing in the computer science research body of all your readings.</p>

        <p>A great way to do this is to find all the literature reviews and surveys in your topic in Google Search.</p>

        <p>Then read them all.</p>

        <p>Look at all their citations and look up all articles which cite them.</p>

        <p>You can see them like this...</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-4.png" alt="Click cited by">

        <p>Click 'cited by' and you will see all the articles that cite it.</p>

        <p>To see citations the paper uses, look at the bottom at references.</p>

        <p>You can guide your learning by looking backward in the past and forward in the future of literarture reviews and surveys.</p>

        <p>As well as searching on your own.</p>

        <p>After reading this blog post, you can check out my other article on <a href="how-to-make-progress-reading-computer-science-research-papers.html">how to read computer science papers</a>.</p>

        <p>I will be leaving all links in the resources section below.</p>

        <p>But this article will be only about <em>writing</em> a paper.</p>

        <p>Try to read minimum 50-100 articles before even considering a specific research paper topic or writing an outline for your research paper.</p>

        <p>Keep notes about the topic you are reading about as you go and learn terminology, concepts and note potential writing ideas you may have as you fulfill your minimum 50-100 research paper requirement.</p>

        <p>There are so many ideas and concepts you have to learn out there. You will have a completely different perspective after say 50+ articles.</p>

        <p>You will also see patterns and formatting which will help you in future writing.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-5.png" alt="Literature review search">

        <p>To start though, read literature reviews & surveys first.</p>

        <p>Afterward if the surveys and reviews you see out there seem lacking in more recent research, then you can make your own survey or review, depending on which is missing.</p>

        <h2>Survey vs review</h2>

        <p>When searching for literature reviews & surveys, a survey is a summary of literature or a selection of articles.</p>

        <p>For example you can choose the most recent 50 articles in the computer networking field and make a summary of those and call it a survey.</p>

        <p>A review is the same thing but includes a deep analysis of what is missing in that whole topic's body of research in the past few years.</p>

        <p>A survey is easier to make but a review is more useful for future research.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-6.png" alt="References example with 100+ citations">

        <p>Typically a review requires more included articles than a survey, often between 100-350 research articles.</p>

        <p>Often reviews will tell you what you can research in the future. You should be able to bounce off of those.</p>

        <p>If you are really gung ho about making an extraordinary literature review, then after reading this article you can watch this...</p>

        <p><strong>How to Write a Systematic Literature Review Paper for High Impact Factor Journals? A/Professor Vidy</strong></p>

        <p>I heavily benefitted from that video as it explains the entire process of getting into a difficult journal using literature reviews.</p>

        <p>But yes, I have some good things to say here too so read on...</p>

        <h2>You only need 1 contribution</h2>

        <p>The goal is to contribute somehow. 1 contribution is enough, more is better.</p>

        <p>You cannot expect to get published without some type of contribution.</p>

        <p>I will give you examples of some contribution types.</p>

        <p>I only write them to you so you can keep them in mind.</p>

        <p>I do not expect you to memorize this or even truly understand it.</p>

        <p>It is just to give you a quick taste of what is out there.</p>

        <p>So you can just read about the contribution types and leave it at that.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-7.jpeg" alt="Spices representing contribution flavors">

        <p>Contributions in research papers have to have a sort of flavor to them.</p>

        <p>While in a blog or newsletter you can rehash known information in any manner and no one cares.</p>

        <p>In research papers they typically have to read <em>as though</em> new and novel to the current body of research.</p>

        <p>They don't truly have to be but <em>they have to read as if they were novel</em>.</p>

        <p>After reading a good chunk of research papers you should see a pattern as to how all these authors dress their contributions.</p>

        <p>You will have to think of your contribution and dress it like the others.</p>

        <p>If it tastes the same as how other authors write research then it should be publishable.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-8.jpeg" alt="It all seems fancy but its well dressed">

        <p>But it has to at least <em>seem</em> like you paper has minimum 1, ideally 2-3 novel contributions.</p>

        <p>Here are some solid examples of contributions you can make:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A dataset</li>
            <li>Novel implementations: ML model, simulation, security method</li>
            <li>Novel experiment: typically involves performance or security</li>
            <li>Literature review</li>
            <li>Literature summary or survey</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The contributions can be these or any combination of these.</p>

        <h2>How a dataset contribution should look</h2>

        <p>The dataset should be something no one else has done and is on the larger side.</p>

        <p>Datasets can be retooled from old datasets as long as it is open-source and the change is new to the research body.</p>

        <p>The purpose of datasets in a research paper is for someone else to create their own research paper based on your dataset.</p>

        <p>So keep in mind, if you create a dataset it should be usable by others.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-9.jpeg" alt="Wikipedia example">

        <p>An example I did in the past was use Python to completely scrape 100,000 Wikipedia articles as a dataset for people to use in a custom LLM.</p>

        <p>That was a good dataset to publish and I would write about it as a 2023 version of Wikipedia.</p>

        <p>Though I would consider 100,000 articles to be bit small. I would implement a GPT-2 Model with the dataset as GPT-2 is open source during this time.</p>

        <p>Then make a Wikipedia detector or something just as an example of how to use the dataset.</p>

        <p>For sure, that would get published on a low rejection publisher, so long as no one has done it in the past few years.</p>

        <h2>How an implementation contribution should look</h2>

        <p>An implementation paper needs to be unique and seemingly lofty.</p>

        <p>You can't write a small Python script and expect it to get published.</p>

        <p>It has to be something that looks highly complicated or lofty like other implementation-based research papers out there but doesn't necessarily have to be.</p>

        <p>This paper for example:</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-10.png" alt="Attacking Neural Text Detectors paper">

        <p>Is a fuzzing script for an existing fake text detector.</p>

        <p>It is very simple but shows both an an implementation and experiment contribution for exposing vulnerabilities in an existing model.</p>

        <p>It is not daringly difficult but it seems lofty.</p>

        <p>It takes a popular detector and shows concept by concept how to trick it.</p>

        <p>In the end the implementation was just changing letters to those outside the model.</p>

        <p>But it was dressed really really well.</p>

        <p>Your implementation can be a brand new one or an extension of someone else's implementation.</p>

        <p>In addition, none of these implementation papers read like a ReadMe file on Github.</p>

        <p>When writing about implementation your goal should be to allow the reader to understand the underlying concepts of the implementation.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-11.jpeg" alt="Whiteboard with design concepts">

        <p>Instructions on how to use your implementation or the fine details of the code itself should not be in the paper.</p>

        <p>Instead its about the math, architecture and novel concept behind the implementation or dataset.</p>

        <p>After reading, your readers should be able to rewrite your implementation from scratch concept by concept, assuming they are an expert of course.</p>

        <p>Also, I would say extending someone else's implementation is way easier.</p>

        <p>The GPT-2 example and that paper, Attacking Neural Networks, I gave earlier is an extension of someone else's model so its much faster to implement the code.</p>

        <p>Many researchers never make their own implementations and solely focus on extending other people's projects like in that paper.</p>

        <p>In addition future authors make implementations on that implementation, extending more and more.</p>

        <p>Making a brand new implementation in your first 10 research papers would be very difficult to publish as I would assume you are newer to coding too.</p>

        <p>I recommend at the start using someone else's project or model and extending it.</p>

        <h2>How an experiment contribution should look</h2>

        <p>An experiment for a research paper can be these types...</p>

        <ul>
            <li>A simulation using simulation software</li>
            <li>Human-computer interaction experimentation</li>
            <li>Performance tests on new technology</li>
            <li>Security threats in networking</li>
            <li>Edge cases or security threats in machine learning</li>
            <li>Security threats in lofty looking software engineering concepts or software</li>
            <li>Social engineering using new technology</li>
            <li>Tricking machine learning models</li>
            <li>Enhancing performance of machine learning models</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are many experiments you can try out.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-12.jpeg" alt="Light bulb idea">

        <p>As you read research papers different ideas should come to mind and you will see more and more examples.</p>

        <p>The paper should write out something that is believed in computer science and either affirms it, denies it, explains it or reveals questions about that belief in computer science.</p>

        <p>It can be about computer networks, machine learning, graphics programming, cryptocurrency, computer psychology or whichever topic you find of interest.</p>

        <h2>Start with a publisher with a low rejection rate</h2>

        <p>In the beginning it is a good idea to read articles with a low rejection rate publisher in mind.</p>

        <p>In the future this can change, easily.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-13.png" alt="ArXiv website">

        <p>But right now <a href="https://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> is a common starting point for computer science researchers.</p>

        <p>If it is different in your time, this blog post is evergreen. Just switch that website with whichever publisher is popular to start in your time.</p>

        <p>Publishers like ArXiv have a lower rejection rate than journals but are still prestigious.</p>

        <p>They have a distinct formatting and outline of their articles.</p>

        <p>I recommend reading the publisher you intend to write for first.</p>

        <p>In addition to that read other publishers on Google Scholar.</p>

        <p>But read with the intent of publishing to a journal with a low rejection rate.</p>

        <h2>Look at what is already published</h2>

        <p>Every time you write for a publisher it is <em>required</em> to follow the outline and format of that publisher.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-14.jpeg" alt="Checklist">

        <p>ArXiv for example has a distinct outline and format that you have to follow that appearance to the T.</p>

        <p>Always double check your paper looks very similar to the most highly cited papers by that publisher in your topic.</p>

        <p>As you read your 50+ papers you should start seeing patterns and soon be able to replicate it.</p>

        <h2>You need to always suggest future research</h2>

        <p>The whole reason other Computer Scientists are looking at your paper is to find out what <em>they</em> can research next.</p>

        <p>By giving your readers opportunity to see future research the publisher will find favor with you.</p>

        <p>Using the outline and format of your paper, add a future research section at the bottom.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-15.png" alt="Future research directions example">

        <p>For example, take a look at these 4 paragraphs on ArXiv.</p>

        <p>You don't have to read it, but look how it is right before the conclusion.</p>

        <p>This is a great way to win over a publisher.</p>

        <p>For the reader reading your paper the conclusion should not be the end. There should always be a continuation or future research the reader can follow using your paper.</p>

        <h2>Use LaTeX</h2>

        <p>Microsoft Word or Google Docs is very difficult to use for writing research papers.</p>

        <p>You need an editor which can change the formatting and appearance of your document with colored templates for each publisher.</p>

        <p>Essentially you have 1 document with 3-5 templates for each publisher.</p>

        <p>For this, LaTeX has been the de facto standard of writing research papers for many years.</p>

        <p>Mostly because it is easier to apply to multiple publishers because all you have to do is download the publisher's LaTex template and it auto-formats the paper.</p>

        <p>You still have to edit the fine details but you should be able to start with an example paper like this...</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-16.png" alt="Overleaf template example">

        <p>It is basically a pre-written research paper with example text.</p>

        <p>Most publishers have their own templates out there on the internet.</p>

        <p>If you use Overleaf for example, you select a template. Then you copy and paste your article text into the template and voila. You have a formatted paper for whichever publisher.</p>

        <p>What is cool, if you apply another template, for example ACM's publisher templates, your paper will get automatically converted.</p>

        <p>You still have to edit the paper but its much easier to start pre-formatted like this.</p>

        <p>Think of LaTex as a really advanced markdown with automation for converting the format of your articles.</p>

        <p>Many editors exist for LaTeX which you can search out there.</p>

        <p>Today, most academic researchers use <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>.</p>

        <p>The most used editor can be different in your time but I expect LaTeX will live long in academic research.</p>

        <h2>Litter your paper with citations</h2>

        <p>You need 5-7 citations minimum per page littered throughout the paper. Of course you are re-using them as you write.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-17.jpeg" alt="Paprika representing citations">

        <p>At the end of the paper you should have at least twice more citations than pages.</p>

        <p>So if its a 10 page paper there should at least be 20 citations.</p>

        <p>Though having many many more is way better.</p>

        <p>Often more citations is better as it makes you look like you did a lot of research.</p>

        <p>They should be relevant and they should actually contribute to both you and the reader understanding your paper.</p>

        <p>There is a formatting that is necessary in your paper and citation section.</p>

        <p>I highly recommend <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/search/">Mendeley</a> for managing citation and organizing your paper.</p>

        <p>When you are done with this article I talk about citation management in <a href="how-to-make-progress-reading-computer-science-research-papers.html">how to read computer science articles</a>.</p>

        <h2>Apply to many journals</h2>

        <p>I have seen people apply to 8+ journals and improve their article every rejection with the publisher feedback.</p>

        <p>It is likely you will get rejected on your first try to submit to a publisher.</p>

        <img src="../images/how-to-write-a-computer-science-research-paper-img-18.png" alt="ArXiv submission interface">

        <p>When applying to that first low-rejection publisher you should get some feedback as to how to improve your article.</p>

        <p>They should tell you what you need to do to resubmit.</p>

        <p>Follow all the feedback and try again.</p>

        <p>Once you are published, hopefully it works out, you may want to try to get into a more prestigious journal.</p>

        <p>Reformat your article in LaTeX to that publishers format and submit.</p>

        <p>Do this for multiple journals.</p>

        <p>You will get rejected many times.</p>

        <p>It is highly likely as you improve the article and increase your publisher submission count, you will get published.</p>
