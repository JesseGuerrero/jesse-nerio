    <article class="content">
        <p>If you ever wondered what it is like to be an advanced developer I want to give you some clarity.</p>

        <p>First, lets define advanced.</p>

        <p>An advanced developer is advanced in a niche. Once they switch niches they restart as a noob.</p>

        <p>Yes, previous niches make you faster at learning new niches.</p>

        <p>But if we define what it means to be advanced in one niche, I would say it like this...</p>

        <ol>
            <li>You can solve 95%+ of coding problems without asking people. Just you, your LLM and the internet.</li>
            <li>You can pump out performant code.</li>
            <li>It is all clean.</li>
            <li>You can pump out a LOT of it.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>What do I mean by all this?</p>

        <p>Well, if you divide a major project into 1000 smaller projects that you have never done before, you should be able to solve nearly all of them without help.</p>

        <p>All your code is performant. It is clean.</p>

        <p>How much is a lot of code? Well I consider myself an intermediate web developer and I can pump out 15 fully logical backend endpoints in a day.</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-0.jpeg" alt="Photo by Lala Azizli">

        <p>We are not talking small functions and logic either.</p>

        <p>Most of these endpoints require pagination, filtering, sorting, schemas, edge cases, special libraries, other micro services and the endpoint has to fit the React developer.</p>

        <p>I have to give forethought to it all.</p>

        <p>I can create a system design then make 30+ required endpoints in like 2-3 days.</p>

        <p>Fully functional, clean and performant.</p>

        <p>And that is not even senior dev work.</p>

        <p>A true senior dev pumps out 25+ endpoints, creates whole projects in like a week, is managing 7+ code bases and its all clean and performant.</p>

        <p>I know developers like that, I have seen them program like that live on camera.</p>

        <p>When I showed off how much code I pumped out in a day to my senior software friend he said, "cool story bro, now do it again".</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-1.jpeg" alt="Cool story bro meme">

        <p>This is the reality. Not all senior devs with 12+ years of experience get there.</p>

        <p>There are many many people in high positions who are not truly advanced developers.</p>

        <p>And, the same, there are many many developers out there who are truly advanced.</p>

        <p>They are unfathomably good at coding in their specific niche and it blows me away...</p>

        <h2>Learning when advanced</h2>

        <p>You would think as you advance you would learn less.</p>

        <p>I mean there is a point where you finally just know most of it.</p>

        <p>You know more so there is less to know right?</p>

        <p>Wrong!</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-2.png" alt="South Park">

        <p>The world of programming is so vast, near infinitely, so wildly large the more you know the more you discover you don't know.</p>

        <p>What actually happens is you fill the pre-requisites for the stuff you didn't know.</p>

        <p>To learn Kubernetes you need Docker, to use Docker well you need command line.</p>

        <p>To develop a a solid backend you need MVC knowledge and frontend knowledge. Then you need to place it in a container, scale it to kubernetes, make load balancers.</p>

        <p>Oh btw there are dozens of choices of tools and the standards switch up every 3 years.</p>

        <p>You learn this and discover the rotations and cycles which were only possible to see in retrospect.</p>

        <p>New technology comes out? Great, time for another cycle. This time I will actually pivot to learning something new.</p>

        <p><strong>As you advance you learn more not less. Faster, not slower.</strong></p>

        <p>For example, after 10 years of learning to do web development, you are finally ready to do project architecture work in some niche.</p>

        <p>You discover there is a whole world within systems engineering itself.</p>

        <p>And all those 10 years of development were a prerequisite the whole time!</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-3.jpeg" alt="Whaaat reaction">

        <p>After 20 years of programming it should feel like you barely scratched the surface.</p>

        <p>Yes, you will be able to do almost anything within the niche.</p>

        <p>But, if you are doing it right you should be learning faster than ever according to the time you put in.</p>

        <p>You should be able to study 1 hour and on average learn the most you ever have in that hour.</p>

        <p>Amount learned/hour gets higher as you advance.</p>

        <p>You appear like a genius, when in reality you just fulfilled the entry level prerequisites after 10 years.</p>

        <h2>Other developers will seem smarter</h2>

        <p>Truly, as a beginner we cannot fathom the depth of understanding from a true senior engineer.</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-4.jpeg" alt="Photo by Alex Rose">

        <p>What you discover is that senior engineer you know, actually knows more than you thought before.</p>

        <p>The more you know, the more the senior dev appears to know.</p>

        <p>More than you could have ever conceived.</p>

        <p>At least if you are hanging around fully committed seasoned developers.</p>

        <p>We see them in their collared shirt and Goofy shorts and think nothing more.</p>

        <p>When in reality they are a massive totem encyclopedia we could never understand unless we already read it.</p>

        <p>People just unassumingly say "hey man" and the senior dev just says "hey" and no one has a clue that guy is walking around with that much, have to say it... knawledge! Freakin Tai Lopez man.</p>

        <p>Professional engineers seem so much smarter as you advance, it is pretty wild..</p>

        <p>The more you learn the more you see they already knew what you did!</p>

        <p>In fact, those 20+ year veterans did it like 10 years ago and they have been learning the whole time even further then where you are now!</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-5.jpeg" alt="Photo by Sigmund">

        <p>For me when I discovered how cool system designs were and how test driven development is so cool, my senior friends called me a noob.</p>

        <p>Like really? Yea really. That's beginner stuff Jesse, keep pumping out code.</p>

        <p>If you want to really get advanced, you should be able to design projects in a topic, database and all, without even looking at the code.</p>

        <p>Compact productiveness is part of being an advanced dev. It is a skill that must be learned in of itself. Can you pump out the work in 3 hours just in time for lunch?</p>

        <p>"Oh btw Jesse I got to where you are at 5 years ago, look at all these humungo projects I completed." In literally 5+ languages, tools and all kinds of things.</p>

        <p>Just mind blowing how fantastically productive these types of devs are.</p>

        <p>And developers like this are not even rare. There are plenty in every niche.</p>

        <p>From graphics programming, operating systems to web development. They exist in every field.</p>

        <p>What is even crazier, these people are not even particular geniuses.</p>

        <p>They <em>earned</em> their genius through learning code over time, <em>for years</em>....</p>

        <h2>Respect from other developers</h2>

        <p>Another transparency, some programmers won't talk to you unless you are at least an intermediate dev.</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-6.jpeg" alt="Photo by Christian Buehner">

        <p>They have become so good it requires patience to tolerate beginners.</p>

        <p>They have totally forgotten what it was like to just start programming.</p>

        <p>I swear its like joining a club.</p>

        <p>I remember joining voice calls and being too new to really know what was going on.</p>

        <p>I was ignored by project leaders. They would get frustrated with my "basic" questions.</p>

        <p>Years later I join these same voice chats, we speak and I respond with understanding.</p>

        <p>They think, "finally a human being and not some random noob".</p>

        <p>It is a bit elitist I know, but that is how a lot of devs think.</p>

        <p>By being able to demonstrate proficiency advanced developers will actually talk to you.</p>

        <h2>You appear smart but don't even know it</h2>

        <p>It turns out most developers are beginners. At higher levels you can talk about things that seem basic to all the advanced developers but to a new person we might as well be speaking a foreign language.</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-7.jpeg" alt="Photo by Marc Lopez">

        <p>Beginners are in the heat of battle trying to reach greater heights and we just rep all the things they are really struggling with.</p>

        <p>Its funny how more experience tends to lead to an underestimate of all the effort it took to get to the present.</p>

        <p>Because of this you appear smarter than you even view yourself to all the non-experienced devs.</p>

        <p>It feels nice to garner respect and the good developers wield it well with kindness. Those are the guys I love talking to.</p>

        <h2>Imposter syndrome fades</h2>

        <p>This might just be me, but I don't have imposter syndrome. Not at all.</p>

        <img src="../images/from-novice-to-ninja--what-it-really-means-to-be-an-advanced-developer---img-8.png" alt="Among us">

        <p>I have the opposite, I believe I can do everything or anything.</p>

        <p>It could be a personality trait. But, I did notice a trend about it.</p>

        <p>The more I knew about a particular niche, the less of an imposter I felt in it.</p>

        <p>Sounds basic, but that is how it worked for me.</p>

        <p>See a job that says AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Spring, backend engineer.</p>

        <p>I feel imposter syndrome. "I am not ready, what the heck is Kubernetes, what does AWS even look like".</p>

        <p>Then I study all 4 of those 6 months straight, doing 3 months of AWS, 2 months of Docker -> Kube, 2 months of Spring.</p>

        <p>Guess how I feel after that?</p>

        <p>Almost no imposter syndrome. This has to be trend. It just has to be.</p>

        <p>If you have done the thing before and you know what its about, the imposter syndrome has to get reduced. How could it not?</p>

        <p>Is that the cure? I think in many cases it is.</p>

        <p>Advanced developers have less imposter syndrome than beginners.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>
