    <article class="content">
        <p>This is going to sound hard.</p>

        <p>But, if programming didn't seem overwhelming to you.</p>

        <p>If it did not seem hard, then you are doing it wrong.</p>

        <p>Programming is hard.</p>

        <p>It takes a long long time to truly get good at it.</p>

        <p>But do you know why we programmers do it?</p>

        <p>Because we LOVE programming. It is so freaking cool!</p>

        <p>You are creating something that can last forever, that fits your imagination, shows off how smart you are, and one day can make you a lot of money.</p>

        <p>It is an amazing craft that builds character, makes you smarter and gives you purpose...</p>

        <h2>The Common Developer</h2>

        <p>I have seen countless developers who earn their degree in Computer Science and believe they have <em>learned programming</em>.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-true-answer-to-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-programming-and-why---img-0.jpeg" alt="Graduation cap and diploma">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Susan Weber</p>

        <p>At the same time I have met young programmers who only have a high school degree, and are more proficient coders than PhD professors (in Computer Science)</p>

        <p>And, it kinda makes sense.</p>

        <p>Programming is not something that is taught as much as it is something that is trained.</p>

        <p>Trained to oneself.</p>

        <p>Many developers believe by just enrolling in a Computer Science program they will <em>learn programming</em>.</p>

        <p>I have seen it though.</p>

        <p>Students who get their Bachelors and Masters in Computer Science and they don't know how to create a class in <em>any</em> programming language upon graduating.</p>

        <p>The difference between a student who does not learn coding while in college and the one that does, is simply their self-study.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Iewek Gnos</p>

        <p>Passive learning, going to class, passing all your homework, writing papers & pseudocode is not the way to learn programming.</p>

        <p>Don't get me wrong, a Computer Science program can be the best thing for you. Especially if you are learning to code while taking courses.</p>

        <h2>What Do You Mean Learning to Code?</h2>

        <p>But, what does learning to code mean to most people?</p>

        <p>Typically, it means becoming an autonomous coder.</p>

        <p>This means, are you able to solve 90% of problems?</p>

        <p>A problem would be 1 of 1000 pieces of a larger project.</p>

        <p>If you want to build a website, can you divide it into 1000 steps and solve 900/1000 with just your notes, AI helper and the internet?</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Markus Winkler</p>

        <p>With this goal of becoming a autonomous programmer you must also pick a niche.</p>

        <p>The true way to word this for your goals is, "can I solve 90% of problems in a chosen niche?"</p>

        <p>That is a good and worthy goal to strive for.</p>

        <p>It is specific and solid enough to imagine and strive for.</p>

        <p>So, lets rephrase the whole question:</p>

        <p><strong>"How long does it take to become an autonomous programmer in one niche?"</strong></p>

        <p>Ah, there we go, much better.</p>

        <p>This I can answer and this is what most people mean.</p>

        <h2>How Long Does It Take?</h2>

        <p>If we answer this question we have to separate the programming journey into three parts</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Programming fundamentals</li>
            <li>The language</li>
            <li>A niche</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Learning just the programming fundamentals and the language can take 1-5 years depending on a few factors.</p>

        <p>Be encouraged though!</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Alex Shute</p>

        <p>If you want to be a top 10% developer in a niche I am explaining how it is done and how long it takes.</p>

        <p>The way I always will and have explained programming is to gather more <em>complete</em> knowledge of your topic.</p>

        <p>Though this picture of time and effort is optimistic. There are many things that happen in between. This means many many hours of (hopefully fun) learning.</p>

        <h2>The two biggest factors on your learning speed</h2>

        <p>The two indicators of how long it will take to learn, is #1 your passion.</p>

        <p>Passion makes you immune to fatigue.</p>

        <p>It allows you to write code 6+ hours a day and lay in bed with a smile.</p>

        <p>It creates a perseverance and long-term commitment.</p>

        <p>#2, your current intellect.</p>

        <p>Differing intellect makes two otherwise equal people learn at dramatically different speeds.</p>

        <p>The slower one may take 1.5 years to learn a language and fundamentals while the faster one may take 6 months for the same.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Fab Lentz</p>

        <p>Be encouraged. By the end of the 1.5 years for the slower person, intellect will improve a LOT.</p>

        <p>Often the smart ones quit as they did not build character. Everything was just too easy for them.</p>

        <p>Always cultivate and protect your passion.</p>

        <h2>Programming fundamentals</h2>

        <p>This is the shortest phase of becoming an autonomous programmer.</p>

        <p>You should dedicate special time to learning the basics.</p>

        <p>After that special time, it will take time while coding to truly grasp everything.</p>

        <p>The fundamentals bleeds into learning a language</p>

        <img src="../images/the-true-answer-to-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-programming-and-why---img-5.jpeg" alt="Child learning">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Our Life In Pixels</p>

        <p>You start with a good 2-12 hours learning how Computer Science is put together in some introduction to programming course. Then continue learning fundamentals in your chosen language.</p>

        <p>This can be with or without university.</p>

        <p>If I had to put a timeline on it, it would take average 1 year at 3 hours a day.</p>

        <p>More or less is added depending on passion and intellect of course.</p>

        <h2>The language</h2>

        <p>Your first language will take a long time.</p>

        <p>The reason is because you are learning three different things at once.</p>

        <p>You are...</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Learning programming fundamentals</li>
            <li>Learning a whole language</li>
            <li>Learning how to learn to code</li>
        </ol>

        <p>All three at once!</p>

        <p>Once you finish tackling these individual parts every learning project in the future will be easier.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Thao LEE</p>

        <p>For the first language and fundamentals it should take 1-2 years of your programming journey at 3-4 hours per day.</p>

        <p>If you choose a tough language like C++ to start with though, it can take 2-4 years for the first language.</p>

        <p>Here are some time spans for some example languages...</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong>: 1-2 years</li>
            <li><strong>Javascript</strong>: 1-2 years</li>
            <li><strong>C#</strong>: 1.5-3 years</li>
            <li><strong>Java</strong>: 2-3 years</li>
            <li><strong>C++</strong>: 2-4 years</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The reason for these differences is their features.</p>

        <p>For example C++ has <em>all</em> the features of programming. It is the programming language of programming languages!</p>

        <p>While Python has many less features and will lead to a more incomplete knowledge.</p>

        <p>Python will be fast.</p>

        <p>And, C++ will give you a ridiculously deep understanding of programming by the time you become an autonomous programmer with it.</p>

        <p>That is why I encourage learning C++ just as much as I encourage Python.</p>

        <p>This is if you take a direct path and dedicate time every day.</p>

        <p>If you take a good programming fundamentals college class and Udemy course, you can speed this up quite a bit.</p>

        <p>But, at that point you actually won't be spending less time learning to code.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-true-answer-to-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-programming-and-why---img-7.jpeg" alt="Dream text">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Alexander Grey</p>

        <p>You will be spending more time.</p>

        <p>The class will keep you accountable to putting in a minimum number of hours. On top of that you are learning on your own.</p>

        <p>In addition, if you are taking a college class, stick to the programming language of that class.</p>

        <p>It is totally valid to switch languages semester by semester for the sake of your courses.</p>

        <p>It is better that way in university.</p>

        <p>This is the picture I want to portray to you.</p>

        <p>This is how it is done effectively.</p>

        <p>Passionate programmers often commit to this timeline automagically without even thinking about it.</p>

        <p>It is the actual time it takes to become a fast growing developer.</p>

        <h2>A niche</h2>

        <p>Every niche is different. Each takes a different amount of time and effort.</p>

        <img src="../images/the-true-answer-to-how-long-it-takes-to-learn-programming-and-why---img-8.jpeg" alt="Measuring tape">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by William Warby</p>

        <p>I will give you some time spans so you can imagine how long it will take to become autonomous. Remember, these are arbitrary but represent my experience with the niche.</p>

        <p>Also, these are AFTER learning the core language well. Here is a list of niches with some time spans:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game development</strong>: 3-12 years 3 hours per day</li>
            <li><strong>Web development</strong>: 1-5 years 3 hours per day</li>
            <li><strong>GUI/Desktop development</strong>: 6 months-3 years 3 hours per day</li>
            <li><strong>Graphics programming</strong>: 5-20 years 3 hours per day</li>
            <li><strong>Machine learning</strong>: 3-12 years 3 hours per day</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This should provide some clues on the differences and time frames. You add up 1-5 years with the fundamentals and language then the niche.</p>

        <p>For example, if you dedicated your life to web development, it can take 1 to 3 + 1 to 5 years. So, web development can range from 2-8 years at 3 hours per day.</p>

        <p>This is if you do it the right and complete way.</p>

        <p>At the end of it all you will be a total chad at the niche and show off those programming muscles, look at you...</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
