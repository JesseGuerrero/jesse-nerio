        <p>The fundamentals are universal knowledge.</p>

        <p>This is the very definition of fundamental.</p>

        <p>The fundamentals are the most transferrable and essential concepts learned in a topic.</p>

        <p>By knowing the fundamentals you will understand all software, all languages & all frameworks deeper.</p>

        <p>Really, what I am talking about here are the Computer Science fundamentals. These explain the existence of programming & machines, including the theory which interrelates them.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of learning fundamentals, let's say you learn the first 10% of programming fundamentals. That will be 95% applicable to all languages.</p>

        <p>Then after the first 10% of learning fundamentals it lowers to 80%, take a look:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Learning Percentile</th>
                <th>Universal Knowledge</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>First 10%</td>
                <td>95% relevant to all languages</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>First 20%</td>
                <td>80% relevant to all languages</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>First 30%</td>
                <td>60% relevant to all languages</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>First 40%</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>First 50%</td>
                <td>...</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>First 60%</td>
                <td>30% relevant to all languages</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>The fundamentals as you learn them deeper, apply less to all languages, but nevertheless they apply.</p>

        <p>Transferrable knowledge is by far the best way to learn programming as a beginner.</p>

        <p>By focusing on these you will find yourself progressing faster than those who are unaware of the fact.</p>

        <h2>What Are the Fundamentals?</h2>

        <p>Here is a list of the lower 40% of fundamentals. These are used in every niche and framework:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>Custom classes</td>
                <td>What is an algorithm?</td>
                <td>Strings</td>
                <td>Generics</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Compiler theory</td>
                <td>Data structures</td>
                <td>Primitives</td>
                <td>Collections</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Language syntax</td>
                <td>Functions</td>
                <td>Dictionary</td>
                <td>Data type modifiers</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>File I/O</td>
                <td>Variables</td>
                <td>Recursion</td>
                <td>Pointers</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Casting</td>
                <td>Data types</td>
                <td>Control structure</td>
                <td>Exception Handling</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Loops</td>
                <td>Math</td>
                <td>Inheritance</td>
                <td>Abstraction</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Operators</td>
                <td>Arrays</td>
                <td>Interfaces</td>
                <td>Imports/dependencies</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Constants</td>
                <td>Hardware layout</td>
                <td>Polymorphism</td>
                <td>Scoping</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>Essentials</p>

        <p>Review this table. Do you understand all these?</p>

        <p>There is more.</p>

        <p>But this table captures enough to imagine what I am talking about.</p>

        <p>If one day, you are able to read this table and understand all of it, you have progressed in transferrable skills.</p>

        <p>Later on, as you advance you will discover there are fundamentals to each niche as well.</p>

        <p>There are typical lists of fundamentals which are transferrable for that niche across languages and frameworks.</p>

        <p>But these fundamentals I display here are for programming <em>in general</em>.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-2.jpeg" alt="Photo by Lee Campbell">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Lee Campbell</p>

        <p>If, for example you wanted to get into web development you will have to learn the fundamentals <em>first</em> for web development.</p>

        <p>For any niche you start learning there will be even another list of fundamentals just like this one.</p>

        <p>But what you will find is knowing the fundamentals of that topic carries over to every framework and language that is meant for that niche.</p>

        <p>Niche examples include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Graphics programming</li>
            <li>Game development</li>
            <li>Machine learning</li>
            <li>Mobile development</li>
            <li>Front-end development</li>
            <li>Back-end development</li>
            <li>Desktop development</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>By learning the fundamentals of that niche you will have transferrable skills between say Java Spring <-> Node Express.</p>

        <p>For me, I am able to switch web development frameworks very quickly because I understand the fundamentals.</p>

        <p>But, I do not understand the fundamentals of graphics programming enough to do so. I will have to learn the fundamentals first.</p>

        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Our Life in Pixels</p>

        <p>After learning a language or framework I should follow a full course on graphics programming for the fundamentals.</p>

        <p>Though...</p>

        <p>All of these niches are based on general programming fundamentals and when starting that is focus.</p>

        <h2>How to Learn Programming Fundamentals?</h2>

        <p>The first way to learn the fundamentals is to follow an introduction to programming course. I typically recommend this one:</p>

        <p><strong>Introduction to Programming and Computer Science - Full Course</strong></p>

        <p>Though to be fair to you, there are no really in-depth introduction to programming courses that I could find.</p>

        <p>Most course instructors follow a programming language and teach the fundamentals along the way.</p>

        <p>Besides learning fundamentals directly, learning a language will naturally teach you these essentials.</p>

        <p>If you are a beginner, I recommend watching that introduction to programming and afterward focusing on a language.</p>

        <p>Though, a lot of self-study is required.</p>

        <p>Now, let us get into questions you should be asking as a beginner.</p>

        <h2>What Am I Supposed to Be Learning About IDEs?</h2>

        <p>When doing full courses, especially at the beginning, you should use the IDE of the instructor.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-4.jpeg" alt="Photo by Danial Igdery">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Danial Igdery</p>

        <p>As you program you should develop workflows around different IDEs.</p>

        <p>I recommend starting with 1 or 2 softwares and really understand the IDEs well.</p>

        <p>You should be googling how your software works, stacking knowledge upon knowledge.</p>

        <p>It is like being an author and learning Microsoft Word.</p>

        <p>As an author, knowledge of Word is hyper important.</p>

        <p>You need some way of expressing yourself well.</p>

        <p>As you follow a full course usually the instructor will explain the IDE.</p>

        <p>Try to get as good as you can with it.</p>

        <p>Give yourself time to adjust to it.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-5.jpeg" alt="Photo by Immo Wegmann">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Immo Wegmann</p>

        <p>Later on when you are more advanced you can become IDE agnostic.</p>

        <p>To where you can program on any IDE.</p>

        <p>Yes, your effectiveness & efficiency will vary per IDE.</p>

        <p>But, many projects are locked into one software.</p>

        <p>Eventually you will have to leave your primary IDE to participate with a group.</p>

        <p>But, to start use 1 IDE, max 2.</p>

        <p>You will find IDEs also require transferrable knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Why Are Data Structures Important?</h2>

        <p>The idea of data structures seems very ambiguous and strange.</p>

        <p>However, they are the very core of programming.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-6.jpeg" alt="Photo by Ian Taylor">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Ian Taylor</p>

        <p>All data structures means is to store data.</p>

        <p>Store data in a structured way.</p>

        <p>This means as a String or a character or an integer.</p>

        <p>All those are data structures.</p>

        <p>From the lowest level hardware to the highest level web app, data structures are there.</p>

        <p>Another word for data structures is just, "memory".</p>

        <p>Are you saving your data?</p>

        <p>In what structured way are you saving your data?</p>

        <h2>Why Do We Have to Learn Algorithms?</h2>

        <p>Algorithms are also a core of programming, really there are two cores.</p>

        <p>They are first data structures then algorithms.</p>

        <p>It means, how do you manipulate memory?</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-7.jpeg" alt="Photo by Jorge Salvador">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Jorge Salvador</p>

        <p>First you must store something in memory, either a 1 or a 0.</p>

        <p>But how do we manipulate it?</p>

        <p>This is an algorithm.</p>

        <p>All you are really doing is flipping 0s & 1s around until the monitor light thingy does what you want.</p>

        <p>In college, after taking Introduction To Programming 1, 2 & 3 you take an algorithms class.</p>

        <p>They will tell you to memorize dozens upon dozens of famous algorithms.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-8.jpeg" alt="Photo by Andrey Sizov">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Andrey Sizov</p>

        <p>Often developers think learning algorithms is memorizing ones that exist.</p>

        <p>I believe it is better to learn how to create <em>your own</em> algorithms in code.</p>

        <p>But, if you start competitive programming then yea, memorizing algorithms is important.</p>

        <p>But, as for the essentials, learning to create your own is key.</p>

        <h2>Does Compiler Theory Really Matter?</h2>

        <p>Yes. The main reason you need to know how compilers work is so you can use build tools.</p>

        <p>Build tools help you use pre-written code AKA dependencies.</p>

        <p>All compiler theory is, is knowing how that language processes your code and makes it executable.</p>

        <p>If you know how a language is compiled or interpreted build tools becomes much more intuitive.</p>

        <p>Take a look at the process for Java:</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-9.png" alt="Java compilation process diagram">

        <p>In Java this is how your source code is compiled down.</p>

        <p>The source code is converted to an intermediate language called byte code.</p>

        <p>A virtual machine or operating system within an operating system runs the byte code and talks with the host OS.</p>

        <p>So along this process, where does pre-written code AKA dependencies get inserted?</p>

        <p>It is inserted at the byte code level during compilation.</p>

        <p>Let's just pretend we know where the pre-written code is placed.</p>

        <p>When you watch a course on a build tool like Maven, hyper important.</p>

        <p>You will see how dependencies are inserted with automation.</p>

        <p>Without compiler theory Maven will appear very ambiguous.</p>

        <p>I have met experienced Java developers who do not know the compiler theory.</p>

        <p>They can code great, but don't really understand how things are compiled.</p>

        <p>They spent 3-4 days trying to get Maven to build the right libraries.</p>

        <p>After much frustration they asked me for help.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-10.jpeg" alt="Photo by Tim Gouw">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Tim Gouw</p>

        <p>This developer has been programming 15 years.</p>

        <p>But because I studied compiler theory in Java, then <em>afterward</em> the build tool Maven, I was able to solve his problem in 10 minutes.</p>

        <p>By understanding compiler theory Maven can actually be easy to learn with a Udemy course.</p>

        <p>I often run into problems like this in every language.</p>

        <p>So, whenever you are learning a language and they talk about how things are compiled or interpreted, know it is important.</p>

        <p>It will help you.</p>

        <h3>Every language has different compiler theory</h3>

        <p>Every language compiles differently.</p>

        <p>After learning compiler theory for one language the next becomes easier.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-11.jpeg" alt="Photo by Gabriel Heinzer">
        <p class="photo-credit">Photo by Gabriel Heinzer</p>

        <p>C++ for example is much different than Python & Javascript.</p>

        <p>If you learn the compiler theory of C++ it would be much easier to use a build tool like CMake.</p>

        <p>Same thing with Javascript & NPM.</p>

        <p>All these words I am throwing around are just examples of tools which are really built on top of compiler theory.</p>

        <h2>Debugging Errors</h2>

        <p>When it comes to learning programming debugging source code is the primary way to learn.</p>

        <p>Debugging by definition means learning how to make source code do what you want.</p>

        <p>In my definition this process goes from starting up your computer to the errors in your actual code.</p>

        <img src="../images/why-coding-fundamentals-are-important-img-12.jpeg" alt="Workflow by Alvaro Reyes">
        <p class="photo-credit">Workflow by Alvaro Reyes</p>

        <p>Setting up your IDE, learning how to check for errors, understanding how to run dependencies, it is all debugging.</p>

        <p>Often, new developers think debugging is limited to errors in the code itself.</p>

        <p>I take a much broader approach and look at the entire programming workflow.</p>

        <p>Are you optimized? Do you understand it?</p>

        <h3>Within the code</h3>

        <p>Within the code itself there are 4 primary types of debugging errors:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Syntax errors</strong>: Small errors in the actual writing of code.</li>
            <li><strong>Logic errors</strong>: Errors in your own logical thinking in code. Every other type of error could be right but the logic behind the code is not intended.</li>
            <li><strong>Compilation errors</strong>: There is some error after writing the code and before running it. While the program is turning into machine code it errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Run-time errors</strong>: While the program is running, there are errors.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Identifying the type of error is the first thing you must do to solve the problem.</p>

        <p>Where along the process is my code messing up?</p>

        <p>This is another place compiler theory becomes important.</p>

        <p>If you know how a language is compiled it is easier to place the error.</p>

        <h2>Do I Need to Know How Hardware Works?</h2>

        <p>Yes, basic hardware layout is a requirement. You have to know if you are saving your in-code objects on the harddisk, RAM or GPU.</p>

        <p>You also should know if you are processing the program on the GPU or the CPU. You can do both.</p>

        <p>At the beginning you will mostly be saving on the harddisk and RAM while processing on the CPU.</p>

        <p>However as you get more advanced you may begin using GPU processing, GPU RAM, remote storage or others.</p>

        <h3>About binary math</h3>

        <p>If you ever wanted to work on low level programming like C or Assembler, binary math and hardware logic becomes a necessity.</p>

        <p>Many developers never touch the stuff.</p>

        <p>The study of how hardware processes binary numbers is called "Computer Architecture" or "Computer Organization".</p>

        <p>This study will show you how compilers, machine code and the lowest levels of programming work.</p>

        <p>This stuff is really cool and when you talk about it with other developers it makes you look very knowledgeable.</p>

        <p>But, if you are doing high level programming, such as Java or Python, it is something you can delay for later.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
