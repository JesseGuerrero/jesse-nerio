        <h1>Book Review: Does "A Mind for Numbers" Apply to Computer Programming?</h1>
        <div class="meta"></div>

    <article class="content">
        <p>In all my blogs you will see I recommend so many resources and books like these.</p>

        <p>I tell you its all important and you must learn 1000 things.</p>

        <p>But, you are the one choosing what to learn and when.</p>

        <p>My goal for you is to read about what exists, what is helpful and in what way.</p>

        <p>In the end, reviews, books, learning methodologies and Computer Science posts are meant to serve you.</p>

        <p>So, in your list of things to read you can potentially add this book.</p>

        <p>And I will tell you why...</p>

        <h2>What is "A Mind For Numbers"?</h2>

        <p><em>A Mind For Numbers</em> is about learning to learn.</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-0.jpeg" alt="Photo by Chris Benson">

        <p>They are methods self-learning individuals discover and use on a daily basis.</p>

        <p>If you were to spend years learning on your own you would naturally re-invent the concepts in this book.</p>

        <p>Many seemingly geniuses and fast learners often figure this stuff out early in life.</p>

        <p>And it bleeds to all things and is essentially knowing how to think.</p>

        <p>They are universal lessons which apply to all learning, including computer programming.</p>

        <p>They would improve you not just as a programmer but as a person.</p>

        <p>You would have to learn this stuff either way to optimize your speed as a learner.</p>

        <h2>Book summary</h2>

        <p>The old sayings of "I can't code out of a paper bag" or "my mind is just not built that way" are things she actively rebukes in the book.</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-1.jpeg" alt="Photo by Alina Grubnyak">

        <p>A good summary of the book is; your mind is plastic and you can adapt to any engineering or math-based craft with time & proper practice.</p>

        <p>By creating in your craft your mind will adapt.</p>

        <p>But, it is impossible to learn at your potential without the proper learning techniques.</p>

        <p>By banging your head against a wall trying to learn things you will soon discover these methods as they are essential for higher learning.</p>

        <p>But, you can save yourself time and effort by learning these things directly.</p>

        <p>The author, Barbara Oakley, then goes into the various methodologies for improving as a learner.</p>

        <p>Here is a list of them:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Learn through creation</li>
            <li>Always chunk your learning</li>
            <li>Avoid overconfidence, recall the basics</li>
            <li>Recall don't review (recall is more effective)</li>
            <li>The smaller details lead to the big picture</li>
            <li>Aim for understanding not memorization</li>
            <li>Always learn the terminology</li>
            <li>Go between diffuse and focused thinking</li>
            <li>Use multiple senses and mnemonics in memorization</li>
            <li>Make sure you think the information is important</li>
            <li>Etc.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are many more and when summarized in this way they seem trivial.</p>

        <p>But, trust me they are not trivial.</p>

        <p>By adopting these techniques and making them second nature you essentially learn and absorb information with ease.</p>

        <p>Compared to those who never learn these you will look like a smart cookie because of your learning speed.</p>

        <h2>Why does "A Mind For Numbers" apply to computer programming?</h2>

        <p>At first glance the book seems more geared to learning math</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-2.jpeg" alt="Photo by Florian Olivo">

        <p>However, computer programming is an engineering and math-based craft.</p>

        <p>This is exactly the kind of craft she is writing about.</p>

        <p>Dr. Oakley states in her personal story throughout her youth she believed she could not learn engineering or technical skills.</p>

        <p>Her IQ was tested as low as a child and she categorized herself as one whose "mind simply is not built that way".</p>

        <p>Later in life she decided to give learning the field of engineering a good try.</p>

        <p>As she continued with her college education she picked up on learning techniques which allowed her to understand math-based engineering.</p>

        <p>She states with time her technique and practice gave her a "mind which understands the craft".</p>

        <p>Eventually she got a bachelors in Electrical Engineering, a masters of Computer Engineering and a PhD of Systems Engineering.</p>

        <p>I can personally attest after reading this book, many of the techniques listed are essential to absorbing computer science with speed and ease.</p>

        <p>When I read this book 4 months ago I found I had already discovered a great majority of these methodologies.</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-3.jpeg" alt="Photo by Daniel Chekalov">

        <p>After 7 years of learning to code I had naturally put them into practice.</p>

        <p>It was nice to finally have words for the things I came up with.</p>

        <p>Before I read this book I had no clue if my methodologies were valid for everyone.</p>

        <p>They seemed to work for me and when tutoring others people I spoke to often thought my mind just understood programming naturally.</p>

        <p>That my brain structure was naturally built for it.</p>

        <p>I was actually afraid to talk about these techniques as they may seem condescending when said directly as "it will speed up your learning".</p>

        <h2>As your mind adapts you will enjoy computer programming more</h2>

        <p>At the start of programming some people have a brain structure which naturally begets Computer Science.</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-4.jpeg" alt="Photo by Denys Nevozhai">

        <p>What is not often said or even believed is your brain structure <em>can change</em>.</p>

        <p>There are neurological highways, roads and back paths which must be built through practice.</p>

        <p>Whether or not you have these highways at the start does not matter.</p>

        <p>What does matter is your desire and technique in learning.</p>

        <p>No matter which person, brain structure or not, when you are at the beginning of learning to program you should find you can hardly do anything.</p>

        <p>Just making classes, functions and loops should be difficult and seemingly overwhelming at this stage.</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-5.jpeg" alt="Photo by Jolene Faber">

        <p>As you build concept upon concept you should begin to see a bigger picture of computer programming.</p>

        <p>This neurological structure <em>will</em> naturally grow and connect.</p>

        <p>And the more you understand computer science the more fun and useful coding will seem.</p>

        <p>Underlying fundamentals will become more abstract and your thinking will become broad with greater strokes and ease.</p>

        <h2>Changing brain structure happens with time</h2>

        <p>Brain structures change with proper effort and time.</p>

        <p>If you focus on learning & implementation say 2 hours where do most people believe neurological change happens?</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-6.jpeg" alt="Photo by Jad Limcaco">

        <p>Probably in the 2 hours.</p>

        <p>But, although you are exercising your mind in 2 hours the rest of the day, 22 hours is where the magic happens.</p>

        <p>Upon revisiting computer programming the next day you <em>will</em> find your mind has adapted and learned the material deeper than right after the learning session.</p>

        <p>Not only this, the mind built some neuro pathways for you which did not exist before.</p>

        <p>Given spaced repetition of learning you mind begins to see patterns and connects your neuroactivity to every day tasks.</p>

        <p>The author states it like this, "unfocused thinking connects what you learned while focused to the rest of your mind".</p>

        <img src="../images/book-review-mind-for-numbers-img-7.jpeg" alt="Photo by Sincerely Media">

        <p>So if you practice programming 2 hours in the morning then make eggs benedict, all the neuro connections made during practice will connect with those in my cooking?</p>

        <p>Yes.</p>

        <p>That sounds strange, but this is exactly what she says creates genius.</p>

        <p>She calls it diffuse vs focused thinking.</p>

        <p>Between our periods of implementing code we do our daily tasks and our brain structure changes.</p>

        <p>It connects our coding ability to the rest of our mind nerologically.</p>

        <p>Pretty cool right?</p>

        <p>The goal of this book is to change your brain structure even faster.</p>

        <p>I recommend it.</p>

        <p>Anywho, I hope you learned something...</p>

        <p>Happy coding!</p>
